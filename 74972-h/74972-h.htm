“A garden is a beautiful book, writ by the finger 
of God; every flower and every leaf is a letter.
You have only to learn them—and he is a poor
dunce that cannot, if he will, do that—to learn
them and to join them, and then to go on reading
and reading, and you will find yourself carried
away from the earth to the skies by the beautiful
story you are going through.”—<span class="smcap">Douglas Jerrold.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> whole subject of Garden Design is so diverse and
complicated that I must be pardoned for disclaiming any
ideas of completeness for this small and unpretending
book. To refer, however briefly, to the methods of
different workers, and the varied effects obtained by
them; or to present in detail the many phases of garden
making as practised in England to-day, would necessitate
not one volume, but several.</p>

<p>If the reader’s object in perusing these pages is to
find a model or plan which he may slavishly duplicate
in his own garden, he will, I am afraid, search in vain.
Garden “design” is not of necessity formal, and suggestive
though the name may be of set patterns and
geometrical figures, more may be learnt concerning it
in the woods and meadows of Nature than in all the
musty volumes which line the shelves of the professional’s
office. The pleasures of garden making are
so real that each one should jealously guard for himself
the privilege of being his own designer.</p>

<p>It is with the idea of helping the novice to help
himself that I ask his acceptance of whatever may be
of value to him in “The Book of Garden Design.”</p>

<span class="chapt_sub">OF GARDENS AND GARDEN DESIGNERS</span></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">From</span> the earliest times the garden has been regarded
as a fitting adjunct to the dwelling-places of man. The
very name seems to suggest a place of beauty and
repose, where the fairest of fruits and flowers are
collected into a small compass for our special pleasure
and edification. The term “garden,” too, is often
employed in a broader sense, meaning a tract of country,
so lavishly endowed with natural beauties, as to almost
suggest that it is the special property and care of some
master hand, who cultivates his broad acres where we
are content with inches. Eden, where, according to
Milton’s famous description in “Paradise Lost,” the
“cedar and pine and fir and branching palm,” mingled
together in a tangle of sylvan loveliness, was a garden
of Nature. We speak of Italy as the “garden” of the
world, and are accustomed to attribute the same term
to some specially favoured district or locality in each
county at home. From each of these all suggestion of
design is absent; a mightier hand than ours has planted
their groves, watered their fertile valleys, and strewn
the meadows and hedgerows with flowers. To these
favoured spots of earth, those at any rate which are left
us, the garden designer must cast his eye, as he sets
out to learn the rudiments of his craft. Not that garden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
making consists in the endeavour to duplicate a whole
landscape on a small scale—this was an error into which
Brown’s followers blindly fell—but because so much
that is of value to us may be gathered from an intelligent
study of the means by which Nature achieves her most
beautiful effects. The disposition of wood and water in
a stretch of well-balanced scenery, the beautifully proportioned
effect of level and rising ground, of valleys
and hills; all these afford an object lesson, which, at
some time or other, is bound to prove suggestive when
endeavouring to forecast results in artificially arranged
grounds. Nature, then, is the school where the novice
should go to be thoroughly taught the rudiments of his
art. Not only will he learn much that is not to be
found in books, but his love of the picturesque and
beautiful will be fostered and encouraged—a necessary
proceeding if he is to achieve any measure of success as
a maker of gardens.</p>

<p>To a certain extent the good designer is born not
made, but much may be done by intelligent study and a
real fondness for the work, to make up for any lack of
natural ability in this direction. But in order to plan a
really satisfactory garden, one qualification is absolutely
essential: before all things the designer must be himself
a gardener. That is, he must have spent some portion
of his life actually working among the flowers and trees,
whose suitable arrangement he afterwards proposes to
decide. He must have sown and planted with his own
hand, watched the growth of leaf and bud, and observed
the habit of each plant and its adaptability to certain
situations. Colour effects must also be noted, in short,
nothing should be allowed to escape his eye which
concerns the varied phases in the life of the simplest of
the garden trees and flowers. Here lies the secret of
half the failures which have occurred since garden
making came to be regarded as something more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
mere haphazard treatment of a piece of enclosed ground.
Its votaries have many of them been men who knew
absolutely nothing of the ways of flowers, to whom the
wonders of nature were as a sealed book. That they
were clever draughtsmen none will deny, and that
many beautiful gardens were made on paper is equally
to be admitted. But that was all, they were unable to
see how their gardens would look after being planted
a few years—probably they did not care, at any rate
they were miserable failures, as must ever be the case
when a well drawn design is considered sufficient proof
of supreme ability. This class of garden maker is by
no means extinct to-day, and with paper, drawing
appliances, and a few books of plans for guidance, is
able to turn out sketches which, to the uninitiated, seem
to suggest unlimited acquaintance with the subject.
But transfer these designs to the ground, lay out the
paths and beds as he suggests, plant trees and raise
mounds, dig watercourses and build rockeries to
satisfy his caprice, and what do we find? Our garden
is a wretched affair, a thoughtless jumble of half-matured
ideas, a desecration of common-sense and good
taste. Trees are planted where their graceful outline is
cramped and hidden, flowering plants have no possible
chance of displaying their full beauty before us, and
everywhere we look there are signs of ignorance and
wasted opportunity. There is something so contradictory
in the term “garden architect”; it suggest
the union of two totally distinct professions. Bricks
and mortar, cut stonework and terracing, are now
pushed into the garden, with the result that its real
object is lost and its beauties crowded out. The
architect is greedy; not content with designing the
house and its approaches, its stabling and many accessories,
he must needs take the garden in hand also,
and we find his work everywhere and weary of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
endless repetition. But we have brought it on ourselves,
and must either rest content with that we know to be
false, or make an effort to free ourselves from this
meretricious form of art without further delay. All
may not possess the faculty for suggesting a complicated
plan for themselves, but there are few who may not
study the outlines of the subject, so that they may be
better able to control those whom they employ. After
all, the garden should reflect the ideas and taste of the
owner, not of the professional. The art of garden
making consists very largely in the exercise of common-sense
and a due perception of the fitness of things.
These, coupled with a love for flowers and a knowledge
of their requirements, will lead the beginner to success
far more quickly than any ability he may possess for
map and plan drawing.</p>

<p>The formal garden, as it existed in the days before its
modern substitute cast a slur on the word “formality,”
reflected no small credit on the skill and taste of its
originators. There was a sense of breadth and stateliness
about it which is sadly lacking in its modern rival.
Especially praiseworthy were the open stretches of turf,
and bold grouping of trees, which were characteristic of
the time. The planting of avenues, to whose beauty
many of our older houses owe so much, the alleys and
greens bounded with hedges of clipped yew, and the
wide borders filled with herbaceous flowers, were all
pleasing in spite of their stiffness. Aided by handsome
terraces, used only where needed, as at Haddon and
other places, these old time gardens were free from any
suggestion of trickery or deception. Their designers
were men whose ideas, if a trifle austere, were perfectly
honest; they liked their handiwork to display its
beauties in a straightforward manner, with the consequence
that their gardens were well-proportioned,
and clearly betokened that money had been ungrudgingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
spent where necessary. The modern formal garden is
of quite another stamp, with its flimsily-constructed
terraces, its ill-designed vases and statuary. There is a
certain straining after effect noticeable, and a lack of
dignity displayed, which makes this latter a very feeble
imitation of its prototype. How can a modern villa be
expected to act as a suitable foil to a style of garden
design which is a cheap adaptation of that practised at
Versailles or Chatsworth?</p>

<p>But, leaving the formal garden for a moment, and
passing to a consideration of that which was the outcome
of an entirely different set of ideas. The landscape
school of designers believed that severity and stiffness
were totally out of place in a garden, and the only way
to secure artistic and beautiful effects was to go direct
to Nature for a model. This was right in so far as it
went; it became ridiculous when carried to extremes.
If “Capability Brown,” himself the most noted member
of the new school, and his followers had been content
to study Nature, gathering thus many valuable lessons,
and then being content to adapt them to the altered
conditions which the nature of a garden imposed, much
good might have resulted. But instead, their great
ambition was to stifle any ideas they might have on the
subject, and become slavish imitators, trying to reproduce
a whole landscape within the small limits of the garden
boundaries. Brown was hailed as a genius, and his
advice requisitioned in the remodelling of many of
England’s best gardens. All traces of formality were
swept away, the terraces, stately parterres, yew hedges,
and regular-shaped beds were abolished, and the ground
laid out on entirely new lines. This consisted in the
introduction of miniature mountains, streams and torrents,
the latter crossed by bridges; the remaking of paths, so
that they wound in serpentine curves, entailing needless
labour to traverse. At Blenheim, Brown turned a river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
into a valley, with such effect that he is said to have
proudly declared “the Thames would never forgive
him.” He abhorred avenues, and this style of planting
gave place under his rule to the irregular dotting of
belts and clumps at varying intervals over an estate.
There is no doubt but that some of the “follies” of
his satellites were wrongly attributed to him, but, in
spite of this, Brown was a consummate mannerist, and
undoubtedly was the means of spoiling many a good
garden by his efforts at deceptive planting and arrangement.</p>

<p>After Brown’s death in 1784, Humphry Repton was
considered the leading garden designer for many years.
To him we owe the origin of the term “landscape gardener,”
a name chosen to designate a science which
combined the united resources of the landscape painter
and the practical gardener. Repton is entitled to our
respect, in that his schemes were not directed towards
the sweeping away of old gardens, but rather to increase,
if possible, their beauty and attractiveness. He considered
himself a disciple of Brown, but on examination
of his methods and work, we are led to conclude that he
differed from him in many material particulars. Brown
would not tolerate formality in any shape or form, but
Repton, realising that few extremes are pleasing, preferred
to strike a mean, and combine the ideas of the
early designers with those of his predecessor. Thus,
whilst duly appreciating the charms of a garden laid out
with proper regard to natural effect, he wisely saw that
it was ridiculous to attempt to bring this style to the
very doors of the house. Architectural features do not
readily combine with those of the field and moorland.
Hence we find that gardens designed by him were
somewhat severe in treatment close to the house, gradually
merging into a freer and more natural style, as the
work of the builder and mason was left behind. Thus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
by slow gradations, the most formal design was merged
without incongruity into the wild and uncultivated
landscape which bordered the property. Repton also
made a number of sketches in connection with his work,
tending to show how the general appearance of his
garden would change from time to time, as the trees
grew and the idea of newness disappeared. Though we
cannot agree with many of the rules laid down by him
for the benefit of future workers, there is much to
admire in his methods of garden planning and arrangement.
If he cannot be considered as the inventor of any
marked and novel departure (the “gardenesque” style
excepted), at any rate he did nothing to spoil existing
gardens by the introduction of foolish innovations, which
was the fault of many who went before him. Where
his ideas on garden planning must be considered as at
total variance with our own was in the banishing of
many necessary conveniences, simply because they did
not happen to be ornamental or harmonise exactly with
the landscape. A garden is a place of pleasure and
recreation, and there can be no possible harm in erecting
comfortable summer houses, seats and resting places,
from which to view its beauties, even though these are
not to be found in natural scenery of the ideal type.</p>

<p>But the examination in detail of the idiosyncrasies of
each and every garden designer would be, to say the
least of it, a proceeding which could do no good, and
might be productive of much harm. The novice, seeking
for assistance and advice, will be needlessly confused by
any lengthened reference to the various “styles” laid
down as correct by individuals of widely differing tastes
and ideas. After all, when we have laboriously studied
the art of garden making in this and other countries as it
existed over a number of years, and have nodded approval
at the work of a certain exponent, only to find
later that our ideas are more in accord with those of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
successor, what do we find? That the greater part of
what we have read is calculated to perplex rather than
help, and in the end leave us no whit better able to form
opinions as to the right and wrong way of setting about
our own business. Putting aside all minor considerations,
and looking at the matter in the broadest and
simplest light, there are, and have been from time immemorial,
but two styles of garden design. On the one
hand, we have the artificial, on the other, the natural.
The first is generally the offspring of the professional
designer, the paper planner, the lover of architectural
features, the supporter of the makers of fountains,
terracing and statuary. The second can in its truest
form emanate only from the garden lover, the man who
grows flowers and trees for the sake of their individual
beauty, and strives with the materials which Nature
lavishly supplies, to make a picturesque and beautiful
enclosure near his dwelling. From this it must not be
inferred that architectural adornments are wrong, or that
a garden can be made in any situation without their aid.
The contrary is the case. On a sloping hillside, a garden
may only be possible by the aid of terracing: an uninteresting
corner may be redeemed by a well-placed sundial
or statue: a simple fountain, with the music of its
falling water, may by its presence give pleasure during
the long summer days. But in spite of all, architectural
features must ever be the exception, not the rule, in the
well ordered garden, and it is only when they are really
needed to further our scheme of “lawn and tree, flower
and shrub deftly interwoven,” that there is the slightest
excuse for introducing them.</p>

<p>There can be nothing more distressing to the garden
artist than the idea of making gardens to a stock plan.
We are not dealing in wall-papers, ornamental tiles or
mosaic work when we undertake the laying out of a
garden; to this day there are many who think that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
business, if business it may be called, can be conducted
by post. Surely, they argue, the professional, if he
knows anything at all, will have no difficulty in advising
without the trouble and expense of a visit. Given the
dimensions of a plot of ground, what can be easier than
to make a plan on paper showing the positions to be
occupied by lawns, shrubberies, flower beds and walks?
Alas, this is how hundreds of gardens <i>are</i> made, and the
same wretched designs are dumped about the country
like so many copies of a popular picture. A quotation
from the writings of Batty Langley will show that the
man who relies on plans is depending for guidance on a sadly
broken reed. He says:—“Now, as the Beauty of Gardens
in general depends upon an elegant Disposition of all
their Parts, which cannot be determined without a perfect
Knowledge of its several Ascendings, Descendings, Views,
etc., how is it possible that any Person can make a good
Design for any Garden whose Situation they never saw?
To draw a beautiful, regular Draught is not to the
Purpose: for altho’ it makes a handsome Figure on the
paper, yet it has quite a different Effect when executed
on the ground.” Individuals must necessarily have their
peculiarities, and it is right they should: we recognise
the same qualities, perhaps some trick of light and shade,
in a score of totally different subjects painted by a great
artist. But there is no excuse for the designer who, having
laid out one garden to his satisfaction, immediately proceeds
to imitate his previous effort in a dozen different
places. Because a terrace happens to look well in a
hillside garden, there is no reason for supposing that its
inclusion is desirable in one situated on the level. Yet
how many tons of earth have been carted from one place
to another, so that stupid embankments might be raised,
and afterwards fortified with terraces—all this in places
where there was not a hill for miles. Love of imitation
has been the downfall of many an otherwise good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
designer, whose enthusiasm for the work of others has
completely over-ruled his own common-sense. We are
not even meant to imitate Nature, the best of teachers,
but rather look to her for inspiration, adapting the lessons
learnt in meadow and woodland to the altered conditions
which highly cultivated ground imposes.</p>

<p>Nothing to my mind can be less helpful to the garden
maker than the common practice which prevails of instituting
competitions in the horticultural papers, with
prizes for the best garden design sent in. As an encouragement
in the art of draughtsmanship, or a stimulus
to the beginner to use his ingenuity, this form of plan
drawing may prove decidedly beneficial. But to imagine
that the designs themselves are of the slightest practical
use is, in the majority of cases, absurd. An attractive
plan, mechanically adaptable to gardens of varying sizes,
is the greatest temptation which can be set in the path of
the unwary. It teaches men to grub about the earth
with measuring rod and chain, levelling, filling up
hollows, cutting down trees, so that no obstruction may
be offered to the carrying out of the design in its entirety.
Whereas all our thoughts should be for the natural appearance
of the ground, its slopes and gradients, which
harmonise perfectly with the face of the surrounding
country. Existing features should in nearly all cases be
retained, or simply modified to our purpose. Imagine
the wantonness of cutting down a beautiful tree, because
our plan says that a path ought to run where it now
stands; or what possible excuse can there be for ruining
a stretch of fine turf with beds cut in the form of circles,
lozenges and triangles. The moral of all this is plain.
Each garden must be treated, as regards its laying out,
simply and solely on its own merits and possibilities. It
matters not whether we are dealing with a humble quarter
acre attached to the modern villa, or have in hand the
broad surroundings of the country mansion. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
no rule-of-thumb method for either; each is worthy of
just as much love and care as might be bestowed were
it the only garden in the world. Sedding says, “A
garden is man’s report of Earth at her best,” which,
whatever else it may imply, surely suggests that our
best work, and our noblest conceptions of the beautiful,
must be pressed into service if we are to effect any real
improvement. Set styles, and the whims and caprices of
the individual, live but a short time; they are here
to-day, but to-morrow their very name is forgotten.
The next generation will probably eye with disfavour
much of the garden work which is now regarded with
so much satisfaction. But there can be no reproaches
for the man who has worked honestly, endeavoured to
penetrate the hidden ways of Nature, and trusted in his
own common-sense and reason to point out the best
course. The love of flowers and trees for their own
sake, and not because it is fashionable, is the same in
every age, and that form of garden design only is right
which is founded first and foremost on the study of
Nature and Nature’s laws.</p>

<span class="chapt_sub">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Before</span> bringing his attention to bear on special cases,
the garden designer must have clearly in view the general
principles which are the underlying features of all good
work. In this way more real progress will be made,
and far deeper insight obtained into the mysteries of
garden planning and arrangement, than by the most
devoted study of complicated plans, or the careful
examination of the methods of any particular school, no
matter how excellent its teaching. It is useless attempting
to compass the most simple form of design if all the
while we are ignorant of those elementary laws which
are mainly the outcome of common-sense and good taste.
The greatest danger to which the novice is subjected,
that of being hopelessly confused by a multiplicity of
styles, of which by the way we hear far too much, is
considerably lessened if he will but bear in mind the few
laws which tend to show that gardening is not a mere
haphazard science, but one founded on a very sure and
substantial base. It is the neglect of these simple observances
that has caused men like Capability Brown to
be ridiculed, when they might have received nothing but
praise. No matter what style of garden arrangement is
contemplated, or whether we are going to China or
Holland for inspiration, our work is bound to prove unsatisfactory
unless beneath the outer veneer which proclaims
its origin there is observable a respect for Nature’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
teaching, and a due regard for the dictates of artistic
feeling and ordinary good taste.</p>

<p>The first point to be aimed at in all good gardens, is
to secure a reasonable amount of comfort and convenience
for those for whom their pleasures are intended.
Nor is there any defence which can be argued in favour
of an opposite course. A garden is devised primarily
for the edification and enjoyment of man, in the same
way that good pictures, good buildings and other forms
of artistic effort are intended. Mere utility is not sufficient,
neither is mere beauty, it is a combination of the
two which must be sought. In the designing of so-called
artistic gardens many ridiculous schemes have
been perpetrated, calculated in the end to disgust all
right-thinking people, and convince others of the
shallowness of certain forms of modern art. Of what
use is it growing flowers and trees, if no facilities for
close examination are afforded those who use the
garden? Can a design which denies us conveniently
arranged paths, and comfortable resting places from
which to enjoy the best views, be considered in any
way satisfactory? Depend upon it, the man who is for
ever telling us that such and such an arrangement would be
more convenient, but could not be tolerated on the
score of art, possesses but very superficial ideas on the
question. It was folly of this kind that prompted certain
designers to make their paths twist and curve in all
directions: Nature, they said, abhorred straight lines,
so they compelled pedestrians to walk double the necessary
distance to reach any particular object. Any plan
must be regarded with suspicion, which when applied
to the garden affords a pleasing prospect from the
windows of the house, but presents no inducements for
closer inspection. During both wet and dry weather it
should be possible to visit certain parts of the garden;
a paved walk is a great convenience if it can be afforded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
and a cool shady pathway will be much appreciated
during the hot days of summer. The fruit and vegetable
garden should always be within easy access of the
kitchen quarters; and though the tool and potting
sheds ought not to be obtruded, they should be convenient
of access and not approached by narrow, tortuous
paths. On the plea that these and other necessary
conveniences are unsightly they are often banished to
remote out of the way corners, and as a consequence
economy both of time and labour are out of the question.
We do not hide our <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note—original text: cherised" id="cherised">cherished</ins> works of art in
cupboards or attics, but hang them in a good light
where they can be viewed comfortably at all times.
The same should be the case with our gardens, which
deserve to be conveniently situated and readily accessible
in all their parts.</p>

<p>Undue complexity is as a rule totally out of place in
the garden, for the reason that it bewilders the visitor
as to the aims and intentions of the designer. Such
gardens give one the impression that they were designed
piecemeal, each time with no thought for what had
been attempted before. Simplicity does not necessarily
mean formality, it is rather the expression of a set of
ideas in a straightforward, common-sense manner. We
cannot have simplicity when we fill our gardens with
patchwork flower beds, destroying the beautiful surface
of a lawn to make them; neither is tawdry furniture,
ill-designed statues, fountains, sundials and seats,
likely to impress the beholder with feelings other than
those of ridicule or contempt for a display of vulgar
opulence. Wherever we look there should be evidence
of a desire for unity in the several parts, a sense of
breadth and dignity which is the true test of a skilled
workman. So many people persist in confusing this
desire for simplicity with a wish for puritanical severity—straight
walks, bare unbroken stretches of lawn, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
buildings uncovered with creeper or shrub; it is nothing
of the kind, and gardens in which there is the richest
ornament, and the most lavish display of flowers, may
yet remain perfectly simple as regards their planning
and arrangement. At the same time monotony is of all
things to be guarded against, more especially as it is
inseparable from certain forms of design. The most
beautiful scene on earth would soon pall were it continued
with wearisome repetition over a considerable
portion of the landscape. A grass walk bordered with
stately yews is a charming feature where the situation
demands it, but who can deny the weariness occasioned
by endless rows of these solemn sentinels, when reproduced
on every side. Herein lies the reason why the
work of certain designers proves so unsatisfactory. It
is possible to have too much even of a good thing, and
the fact that a certain feature has proved suitable in one
case, is no reason for supposing that it will be equally
satisfactory in half a dozen others. When making a
plan, it should be our object not to consider how much
we may do without incurring the risk of monotony, but
how we may best whet the appetite for more of a similar
character.</p>

<p>It is to variety that we owe the greatest pleasures in
our gardens, and yet there are many who would deny us
even this. It is variety which makes the study of Nature
the pleasure that it is. Who ever saw two woodland
glades exactly the same, two mountain streams which
presented identical features, or a glimpse of lush meadows
and rich, purpling hills which was not different to any
we ever saw before? Why not the same in our gardens?
No two situations are exactly the same, one must possess
features that the other lacks, or present possibilities
incapable of fulfilment except in its own case. There is,
indeed, no reason why we should conform to a stereotyped
plan, except that imitation is usually considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
less trouble than originality, in that the latter involves
individual thought, and a necessary determination to see
clearly to the root of things. But apart from the lack of
variety displayed in the general planning of several gardens
in the same or different localities, there is often a want of
diversity in the various parts of a single garden. This
is the opposite fault to that of undue complexity, and it
is the more pleasant, because of its rarity, when we find
that a happy mean has been chosen. Variety in garden
design can be attempted in a number of ways, either in
the alteration of ground levels, the formation of walks,
or the grouping of trees and shrubs. The first named
must always be a matter demanding extreme care and
judgment, for the good reason that the natural levels
are nearly always best. In the remodelling of existing
gardens, it is often necessary to go to considerable labour
and expense to bring the ground back to its original
form. The craze for terracing which has led to the
upheaval of banks and mounds in all sorts of impossible
positions, has led to an appearance of extreme artificiality
in many modern gardens. However, it is often possible
to so alter levels that variety takes the place of monotony,
and an added charm is given to certain situations.</p>

<p>Perhaps the safest way to proceed in this direction is
to take advantage of some existing depression or elevation,
which, probably too slight to relieve the prevailing flatness,
may be deepened or heightened as the case may
be. The natural grade should be taken as a guide, and
emphasis given to points which admit of such treatment.
The aspect of the surrounding country will exercise considerable
influence in this direction. A garden containing
many mounds, hillocks, and hollows will look absurd set
in a nearly flat landscape, and in a hilly district, cultivated
land wrought into an unbroken level will appear even
more out of place. The fact that building operations
has led to the excavation of a large bulk of earth, should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>not lead the designer to utilise it for promiscuous bank
making. It is seldom that a close survey of the ground
will not reveal points at which it is possible to secure
variety, without altering the general contour to any
appreciable extent.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_016_facing" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_016_facing.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">TERRACE CLIMBERS</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Garden paths nearly always cause monotony when too
much of their length is seen at once. This must not be
considered as in any way deprecatory to the straight
walk, than which often nothing is more satisfactory.
If the path is straight, there should be compensating
influences in the way of well grown plants or shrubs
along its sides to attract our attention. Where these are
impossible, the walk should be made to bend slightly,
occupying the curve with a group of flowering shrubs,
or some other suitable screen to hide its continuation
from view. The garden paths should most certainly
follow the varied levels of the ground, and nothing can
be worse than to attempt to fill up the hollows and shave
off the gentle elevations in order to produce a dead level.
This is the very way to engender the monotony, which
we are trying to dispel. A wild mountain path, or the
track through some woodland glade, never lacks variety,
simply because the feet that made it followed the line of
easiest gradient. In nine cases out of ten, the ugly walk
is the result of direct transgression of this simple rule,
and all that is needed to effect an improvement is the
reversion of the ground to its old level.</p>

<p>The variety obtainable by the judicious employment
of living trees and plants is so infinite, that there is
no excuse for neglecting their friendly aid when planning
the several parts of the garden. A certain spirit of conservatism
seems to prevail among modern gardeners, and
of the thousands of beautiful subjects which exist for our
benefit, not a tithe of the number are pressed into service.
Take, for example, that large and beautiful family, the
Flowering Shrubs, how very imperfectly is their value<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
realised in the majority of cases! Dull, gloomy evergreens
are used almost exclusively in the orthodox small
garden, and never a thought is given to the host of fine
deciduous trees, many of which are supremely lovely.
The nurseryman has learnt by experience the few stereotyped
evergreens which are most in demand, and he
stocks these, and these only, so that the casual purchaser
is led to believe that the list of trees and shrubs suitable
for English gardens is very limited. For screening off
unsightly corners evergreens are of the highest value,
but on the margins of lawns, and for lending interest to
mixed plantations, the designer would do well to introduce
the flowering shrubs, of which a list is given later
in the book.</p>

<p>Anything approaching eccentricity is to be avoided in
the designing of gardens, as is also any scheme which
partakes of the nature of a sham. We all know with
what eagerness the Bank-holiday crowd approaches
counterfeit ruins, trees which squirt water from their
branches, or figures of men and animals cut out of
living box and yew, but such follies are beneath the
consideration of the true garden lover. After all, the
pleasure grounds are primarily intended for the owner
and his family, and nothing becomes more stupid and
pointless on closer acquaintance than these inane pranks,
of which there are hundreds of examples throughout
the country. For the same reason, the making of surprises,
as the sudden revealing of unsuspected features
in the garden scene must always be considered as
evidences of debased taste, the prostituting of a beautiful
art, for the sake of securing a momentary exclamation of
astonishment on the part of an ignorant visitor. A certain
amount of mystery is sometimes justifiable, and
there should always be afforded ample inducement for
closer inspection of Nature’s beauties, but when it is
evident that the designer’s sole idea in creating a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
feature was to occasion surprise, as apart from genuine
pleasure, then it becomes necessary to condemn such
artifices in unmeasured terms. The hidden ways of
Nature should be sufficient mystery for the most exacting
without lowering our gardens to the level of vulgar
peepshows, by the introduction of mazes and freaks of
tree sculpture.</p>

<p>The attempting of too much in a small space is another
fault to be guarded against, though where the designer
is not allowed his own way, this is often a matter of
difficulty. So many people when seeking the assistance
of the professional, impose upon him the necessity of
giving them “a bit of everything” in the way of design.
They must have a rose garden, a corner devoted to rock
plants, a few square feet for carpet bedding, a place for
water and bog plants, a pergola, and much beside, all
without reference to the suitability or otherwise of the
place for such introductions. The idea that a garden
will never lack interest because it resembles a patchwork
quilt in the number of its divisions, is surely erroneous;
the pleasure thus obtained is but momentary, and soon
ceases to become other than wearisome. We look for
perfection in detail, but we must also consider the garden
as a whole, and seek to make its various parts subservient
to one another, the several units of one well-balanced
plan. Undue regularity must also be accounted
a sign of weakness,—</p>

    <div class="verse">And half the garden but reflects the other;”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Proper balance is of course desirable, but the arrangement
of beds in well-matched pairs, or the setting of
vases at each corner of a lawn, is as unnecessary as it is
opposed to all natural laws.</p>

<p>The faculty for seeing in the mind’s eye, the general
characteristics of the garden as it will appear when laid
and planted, is a gift for which, if possessed, the designer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
may be truly grateful. It enables any weak
spots which may exist in the plan to be corrected before
it is too late. Of course no one can determine the exact
effect which time will produce, and it is well we cannot,
for perhaps the greatest charm of garden design is its
delightful elusiveness, the uncertainty which exists as to
the manner in which flower and tree will disport itself.
But unless we attempt to see further than the mere outlines
of the plan, we are trusting to chance to secure for
us the results we most desire. Especially are we liable
to err in the matter of colour effect, a consideration
which is outside the scope of the black and white plan.
Unrelieved stretches of turf become monotonous unless
afforded the foil of suitable foliage; broad masses of
bright hued flowers demand the sober relief of grey
stonework or silvery leaved trees and plants. A certain
spot is often dull and unsatisfying, simply because it
lacks this element of colour; a group of flowering
shrubs with bright hued blossoms or even a stone vase
filled with climbers may dispel all idea of monotony. In
the securing of suitable contrasts, work may be raised
above the merely mediocre, to a level of high artistic
merit. Easy transition of form and colour is no doubt
the safest course to pursue, but a certain boldness of
touch may in certain instances prove highly advantageous.
The shrubbery, often a tame and featureless affair, may
be rendered attractive by the sharply contrasting effects
of adjacent groups of deciduous trees, and the dark,
glistening foliage of evergreens. It is quite possible to
carry the practice of rounding and softening the corners
beyond reasonable limits, and we sigh for some prominent
feature to rivet our attention, if only for the
moment.</p>

<span class="chapt_sub">THE SELECTION OF A SITE</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> are few points connected with the art of
garden design over which greater differences of opinion
are likely to arise, than those associated with the
preliminary consideration—choice of site. For this
reason, the present chapter must inevitably prove more
suggestive than dogmatic; less concerned with particular
instances, than with the broader aspect of the question.
It is rare, indeed, to find two persons, each about to
build a residence and lay out a garden, whose ideas as
to the most desirable site for the purpose are in any
way concurrent. One prefers an elevated situation
from which a good view of the surrounding country
may be obtained; the other dislikes the labour of
climbing, and must perforce live in the valley. The
proximity of other buildings, giving a sense of companionship
and security, is essential to some; others,
again, seek no better society than that of the woods and
silent heath. A man’s profession or hobby will considerably
influence his choice of locality for a home:
the city man must live near a good train service, the
ardent golfer’s first thought is for easy access to the
links. Instances could be multiplied <i>ad finitum</i>, all
clearly pointing to one end, namely this: that it is
useless to regard any one position as ideal, such a conclusion
only being possible when we are fully cognisant
of the peculiarities of the individual for whom we are
working. However, there are certain characteristics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
which, if not indispensable, are at least highly desirable
in almost every case, and in briefly discussing a few of
the foremost considerations which must present themselves
to everyone about to build and lay out grounds,
it is left to each one to modify or alter according to his
own opinions and preconceived ideas.</p>

<p>In the first place, the accessibility of the piece of land
which it is proposed to treat, must be carefully studied,
and this before any possible advantages or disadvantages
connected with the actual site come to be weighed.
The exigencies of modern life demand that ample
facilities shall exist both for ourselves to visit others
and for others to visit us. There are many who have
settled in delightful places in country districts whose
subsequent regret is that they are out of the beaten
track. They can neither make calls nor receive their
friends without great difficulty and inconvenience; and
worse than this, communication with tradesmen, and
the delivery of letters and parcels, are matters attended
with serious disadvantage. A time comes in the lives
of most city people, when the only form of existence
which seems desirable is that known as “buried in the
depths of the country.” As a temporary expedient, or
regarded in the light of a picnic excursion, this is no
doubt delightful enough; but a permanent residence so
situated becomes after a time well-nigh intolerable.
Convenient distance, then, from railway, post office,
shops, and other evidences of civilisation, is the first
point upon which the prospective purchaser must satisfy
himself. Carrying the question of accessibility a step
further, it becomes necessary to ensure that the property
shall be approached by a convenient road. As to
whether the road is little frequented, or is in the
nature of an important thoroughfare, individual taste
and opinion will necessarily be divided, but the main
consideration, applicable in both cases, is that the road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
shall be a good one. No comfort can be expected if the
approach to one’s residence is ill-made and badly kept,—a
mere “boreen,” as the Irish would say. Neither
should it be deemed sufficient that a road is likely to be
made in the near future. The authorities often move
with unaccountable slowness, and cases are by no means
uncommon in which unfortunate residents have been
kept waiting for years before anything more than a
mere track has been made to their property. Whilst
other details may to a great extent be modified and
adapted to meet requirements, this primary consideration
is unalterable: either there is suitable access or there
is not. In the latter case, it is extremely doubtful
whether a host of minor advantages will act as adequate
compensation.</p>

<p>Unless it is proposed to approach the residence by a
fairly long drive, a garden situated beside a main road
has many drawbacks. Chief of these is the dust
which is constantly raised during the summer months.
Especially in this age of motor cars, many otherwise
pretty places are completely disfigured during the time
they should be most beautiful: shrubs, trees and
hedges are alike smothered with a thick covering of
dust. On this account, and for other obvious reasons,
a branch or bye-road, if well kept, is far preferable as a
boundary line.</p>

<p>Presuming that the question of approach has been
satisfactorily solved, the character of the land, its
aspect, surroundings and other details present themselves
for careful examination. Much will depend upon
the class of soil with which we are dealing, not only as
regards its suitability or the reverse for garden operations,
but because it is a matter directly affecting the
health and comfort of the owner and his family.
Heavy clays are of all things to be avoided; they spell
unceasing labour, and endless discomfort to all whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
misfortune it is to work them. Flowers and trees
raised on them are always backward, and if disease is
not actually present, growth is nearly always weak and
stunted. In winter, the land is cold and wet, extremely
tenacious and demanding added strength and perseverance
to dig; in summer, it is parched and baked,
whilst tender plants have no possible chance of making
headway. The greasy condition of the garden walks is
another prominent feature of soils of this description.
All things considered, a light, free-working loam,
resting on a substratum of a gravelly nature, is probably
best adapted to secure greatest comfort to the occupier,
and health and prolificacy to all forms of vegetable life.
Drainage cannot be entirely depended upon to remedy
soils of a cold, heavy nature, and to all whose intention
it is to devote their energies largely to the delights of
garden making, my advice is to shun clay lands by
every means in their power.</p>

<p>The careful designer will devote much attention to the
question of aspect, endeavouring to secure warmth and
sunlight for the most frequented portions of house and
garden. It is generally conceded that land having a
gentle slope towards the south-east more nearly approaches
the ideal than any other. Especially if the
public road skirts the northern side of the property,
allowing the entrance drive to be made from that
direction, and thus leaving the whole of the southern
slope free for lawns and garden, will this aspect prove
pleasing. Nothing can be more disappointing to the
garden lover than the constant trouble experienced in
rearing tender plants and trees in the damp and cheerless
positions assigned to them by certain unthinking designers.
In such gardens the sun is only felt for a fraction
of the day, and as a consequence those beautiful effects
of light and shade, without which the finest scenes are
flat and uninteresting, are conspicuous by their absence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Altitude, as has been mentioned, is generally more a
matter for individual preference and opinion than for the
expression of any decided rules on the subject. Unless,
however, any real objection is felt against land situated
at a fair elevation, I should unhesitatingly prefer it, in
the majority of instances, to that found in flat, low-lying
positions. There is all the difference between the garden
perched high on the bleak hillside, where cutting winds
play havoc with its contents, and that situated midway
down an easy slope, above the line of mist and fog. Providing
that the aspect is sunny, and the soil well-drained,
such a situation is far warmer and healthier than the
apparently more sheltered site lower down. The
designer, too, will find his work easier in the former
case than in the latter. Privacy is seldom attainable in
low-lying gardens; they are generally overlooked, either
by neighbours or by pedestrians on the public highway.
It is next to impossible to screen off unsightly objects
from view, and it is inevitable that the prospect obtained
of the surrounding country is cramped and confined, if
not altogether excluded. On the other hand, an elevated
site safeguards all these objections: it is seldom overlooked,
or if it is, artificial planting and arrangement may
be depended upon to quickly remedy matters; whilst if
fine views exist in the vicinity, the designer is afforded
an opportunity of increasing the scope and charm of his
own handiwork by including them. Altitude is undoubtedly
an important consideration which must be
duly weighed before a satisfactory decision can be given.</p>

<p>Shelter, or rather lack of it, is one of the troubles
which is almost inseparable from newly laid-out gardens;
and as even the most quick-growing trees and shrubs
take some time before they can prove efficient barriers,
natural or existing wind breaks should in all cases be
sought. Natural features will consist of ranges of hills
on the sides of the property most exposed to cold winds—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
north, north-west and north-east. Where these
exist, nothing could possibly be better, but of course
probably not one site in fifty will be enhanced by such
advantages. Plantations, protective belts, and stretches
of woodland are valuable features, which, if existing at
a convenient distance from the proposed site, and facing
the required quarter, will secure it from the ill effects of
high winds. Should the property already contain a well grown
hedge, it may be advisable to retain it as a feature
of the new design, thus providing shelter, and doing
away with the entire appearance of newness which will
otherwise be manifest. Should mature plantations already
exist on the property, great caution must be exercised by
the designer as to his treatment of them. It often happens
that a belt of trees hides a good view, or does not lend
itself to the proposed plan. In the first case the owner
may be tempted to open out vistas by the removal of
timber; and in the second, the entire demolition of the
plantation may be contemplated. Before doing either,
he should be quite certain that, in addition to obtaining
his view or carrying out his scheme in its entirety, he
will not also be destroying a form of shelter which would
take years to replace. Naturally, the surroundings will
exercise considerable influence on the choice of a site, and
here again the tastes of the individual have to be considered,
rather than the opinions of the idealist. The
presence of water, either a lake or stream, in the adjacent
landscape is an unfailing attraction to some; others would
rather face a prospect of meadow and woodland; whilst
there are many who ask no better than that their garden
shall be within sight and sound of the restless sea. In
each respect the individual must please himself, having
in mind, however, that a style of design applicable in one
instance will probably be totally unfitted in another.
There is one thing which the garden lover will surely
guard against with every possible care, and that is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
encroachments of the jerry-builder. So much depends
upon the character of the extended views obtainable from
the garden, that it would be extremely unwise to surround
oneself with land which, in all probability, will be dotted
with ill-designed villas within the course of a few years.
It is worth many little inconveniences to ensure that what
we have we may hold, and that the view which affords
us so much pleasure to-day will be ours for so long as
we care to enjoy it. Factories, ugly churches (of which
there are many), and cottage property of every description,
are features capable of creating a blot on our vista of
landscape, and the ideal site is one on which such objects
not only do not now intrude themselves, but have no
possibility of doing so in the future.</p>

<p>The outlines of the property must also be regarded
as relevant to the question of site, more especially
having regard to the impossibility which exists of
making a satisfactory design for gardens of certain
shapes. All who have attempted to achieve artistic
results with the orthodox villa strip, know the extreme
unsuitability of the narrow parallelogram. It is no easy
matter, again, to secure a well balanced plan, in which
the separate features are not unduly scattered, within
boundaries which are square or nearly so, though this
form is infinitely preferable to the foregoing. Perhaps
the best, certainly the easiest, results are attained when
the outline is triangular, though it is highly important
that the positions of base and apex be considered.
No one desires to curtail the impression of size in their
grounds, and it is generally acknowledged that the
more open and less contracted are the distant views,
the better will be the effect. For this reason the apex
of the triangle should concur with the least interesting
prospect, the base with that to which it is desired to
give prominence. Taking the case of the house and
gardens on the southern slope, the residence should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
at the upper or northern extremity, with the best views,
the gardens and landscape beyond, stretching south-wards.
The chief windows will face south, and on the
extent of the vista, its variety and absence of signs of
foreshortening and curtailment, the skill of the designer
will be appraised. That the garden boundaries should
end in a point does away with all illusion of space; we
mark the sudden transition from the cultivated to the
wild, and our grounds appear as a modest wedge which
is in momentary danger of being demolished by the encroachments
of the neighbouring property. Irregularity
of outline is another feature to which objection may be
raised on account of the extra expense incurred in fencing.
The number of angles, too, renders the making of
boundary paths a troublesome matter, and for various
reasons a free, flowing outline is far preferable.</p>

<p>If a site can be secured on which a number of fine
trees already stand, it should, other things considered,
receive preference over one which is bare and barren.
A well grown tree, grateful on account of its shade,
and beautiful for its stately outline, is one of the most
valued objects in the garden. Should there be too
many trees, it is easy to cut down any that are not
required; it is another matter to plant fresh ones.
However, nothing will be gained by endeavouring to
retain existing features of an unsuitable nature, or by
altering a well balanced plan so as to include some
object foreign to the scheme. In such cases it were
better to start operations in a field destitute of tree,
shrub or living plant, thereby enabling the projected
design to be carried out unhampered by restrictions.
The lack of well grown timber is indeed the greatest
drawback in new gardens, which must perforce continue
for many years before they put on the aspect of maturity,
or even middle age, so that unless there is ample reason
for the contrary, the retention of any suitable specimen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
trees which may occur on the site should be ensured.
Much responsibility attaches to the designer who undertakes
the laying out of a garden on an entirely new site;
he starts absolutely afresh, and cannot lay the blame for
any possible blunders on the shoulders of his predecessor.
Before deciding finally on any one position,
most careful observations should be made, and the
opinion of those in the locality sought as to climate,
presence of fogs, and other details which only extended
residence in the neighbourhood can determine. A good
site, favourable alike as regards soil, aspect and elevation,
is certainly the surest foundation which can be laid
for the future designing of a beautiful garden.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="chapt_sub">WALKS AND LAWNS</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Directly</span> we leave the public road and enter upon the
precincts of the dwelling, the question of suitable walks
and paths at once demands attention. According to the
size of the house and its surroundings, we may have to
traverse a stately drive bordered with noble trees, or
simply a flower-fringed pathway, to reach the entrance
door. The subject of carriage drives must necessarily
be somewhat outside the scope of this little book, which
is destined as a guide for those possessing grounds of
small or medium extent. We find, however, that the
desire for an imposing approach is by no means confined
to those whose property demands a certain amount of
pretension; the owners of quite small places will often
sacrifice anything, that they may have a drive of even
humble proportions. It is to attain this object that the
most fantastically contorted approaches are devised, many
actually running parallel with the main road for almost
their entire length. It may be taken as a fixed rule, only
alterable under rare circumstances, that a drive should be
as direct as possible in its course; the idea that needless
twistings will give an air of importance and dignity to a
place is totally erroneous. I remember once visiting a
house of quite unpretending dimensions, the approach to
which was by way of a drive of astonishing length. In
driving up, one actually passed twice within close view
of the house before arriving at the front door; each time,
instead of taking a direct route, the drive meandered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
away into a wilderness of shrubs. The effect, needless
to say, was supremely ridiculous. If the public road be
straight, or nearly so, the entrance drive should leave it
at right angles, an oblique juncture only being permissible
when the road is decidedly curved. Privacy should be
secured by suitable planting, as it is by no means desirable
that the best parts of the garden or the windows of
the house be overlooked by persons using the general
approach.</p>

<p>Another point which must necessarily be borne in
mind when contemplating a feature of this description
is the expense of up-keep—no insignificant item in the
case of a considerable length of drive. Nothing looks
worse than ill-kept, weedy pathways, and unless constantly
tended and regravelled from time to time, they
soon present a spectacle of dismal neglect. The small
house is generally better approached by a short direct
route, omitting even a carriage court or turn, unless
ample space can be allowed. The seclusion afforded by
a drive is easily obtainable by other means, and the
feeling of pretentious importance which this feature often
imparts is scant compensation for loss of needed ground
for lawns and flower-garden.</p>

<p>Garden walks are capable of great variety of treatment;
they may be laid in several materials, and by their
presence, both utilitarian and artistic ends may be compassed.
The most common fault with designers is the
formation of too many walks, a style of arrangement
which is particularly objectionable in small gardens. An
artificially constructed pathway is rarely in itself a
beautiful object, though it may often appear so owing
to the nature of its surroundings. For this reason a
walk should generally be made to serve a useful purpose,
rather than act as a mere foil to surroundings of a
different type. The walks nearest to the house will, in
many cases, form part of a terrace scheme, and it is well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
that these should be made a distinctive feature. Stone
flags look extremely well, much better, in fact, than
cobbles, which are tiring to walk upon. Dressed stone
is expensive, but it is often possible to obtain suitable
material at fairly cheap rates from the town authorities
who have the disposal of old street pavements. Terrace
walks are necessarily both formal and artificial, and
remarks as to natural levels have no application where
they are concerned. A fair width is advisable, but care
must be taken that the house itself is not dwarfed by
an undue expanse of terracing. If different levels are
attempted, steps should be employed to give access from
one to the other; a sloping path is quite out of place in
a terrace scheme. I do not care for the practice of
working in different coloured materials to form a mosaic;
there should be sufficient variety, both of colour and
form, in the living contents of the garden, without having
to face the necessity for embellishments in stone and
brick.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_032_facing" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_032_facing.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A PAVED WALK</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When contemplating any special features in the way
of design, always consider whether it is possible to
approach them conveniently by a suitable pathway. All
the best views should be readily accessible without the
necessity for traversing possibly wet lawns, or pushing
through heavy undergrowth. Paths leading direct from
the stables to the flower-garden must be broad and well
made, as they will be in constant use for heavy traffic,
carting manure, water barrows, etc. The lesser frequented
walks need not be so wide, and providing that
they do not lead through highly cultivated portions, and
are dry and well made, need not be kept scrupulously
gravelled. A degree of wildness is quite in keeping
with certain parts of the garden, though an ill-kept,
weed-grown path is never permissible. The walks
which traverse the wild garden, orchard and woodland,
will destroy much of the charm of these sylvan retreats
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>if they betray signs of too constant attention—their surface
smooth, the grass edges rigorously trimmed,
and evidences of the line, shears and roller everywhere
apparent. A prim pathway would be a sad eyesore on
the ragged face of the hillside, the mountain track
equally ridiculous winding among shaven lawns and
glowing flower-beds. It is often necessary to effect a
satisfactory transition between these two styles, and this
can only be done by means of a well-marked boundary.
Either a broad hedge, a small gateway, or a short pergola
may be depended upon in most instances to render
the passage from one to the other free from incongruity.
Two walks should never be seen running parallel to one
another for any considerable distance; one or other is
almost sure to appear needless. If the second path is a
necessity, it should be screened from its fellow by suitable
planting. In the same way, the junction of two
distinct paths should be so arranged that there is no
reason to suppose that either one or the other is superfluous.
Repton’s ideas on this and kindred matters
relating to walks are worthy of study and imitation.
He makes it a rule that in the case of two walks branching
off from one another, each should take a decided
outward turn, as though there were no possibility of
their meeting again.</p>

<p>Paths which lead “nowhere” are usually a failure,
and we can most of us recall the annoyance experienced
after following a walk for some distance only to find
that it ended in a cul-de-sac. If such arrangement be
necessary, as it sometimes is, some compensating influence
should always be provided at the end. A small
summer-house, a curved seat and sundial, a well grown
tree inviting rest and shade beneath its branches—any
of these will remove the pointless appearance.</p>

<p>There are absolutely no rules regarding the formation
of serpentine walks, unless they be those of a negative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
quality. Such walks are always permissible and often
charming if they are made in deference to the natural
form of the ground. Divergence from the straight line
is necessary to avoid a group of trees, to skirt a piece of
water, or to embrace some particular view, but not for
the purpose of deceiving the visitor as to the extent of
the property. Twisted walks look very foolish in a
place which obviously possesses straight boundaries, and
however delightful it may be to lovers in the twilight
to linger thus lovingly on their homeward way, the
majority of us are merely annoyed by the mazelike contortions
which the average “landscape gardener” sees
fit to inflict upon us. So long as the curves are pleasing
to the eye, there is no need to make them equal, rather
the contrary; the great point to avoid is the creation of
a hard line between two neighbouring bends.</p>

<p>Grass forms a delightful edging to garden paths, but
it requires to be well kept, otherwise it is unsightly. To
afford facilities for mowing, a level breadth of turf sufficient
in width to accommodate the lawn-mower should
be laid along either side; this is especially necessary if
sloping banks rise immediately from the sides of the
walk. In the wild garden, natural edgings, ground ivy,
cotoneaster, or St John’s wort will look more appropriate
than either mown turf or tiles. Walks and pathways
must always be considered as part of design, but
their utility and convenience should be the first point
studied. It is disappointing to see in many places the
arid stretches of gravel, walks of more than necessary
width, and carriage sweeps large enough to turn a coach
and four: all this lessens the space available for turf and
flowers, and offers nothing in return, as the cost of up-keep
is in no way decreased.</p>

<p>As a recent garden artist has declared, the lawn is the
heart of the British garden. It is the centre of the
social life which, in our too brief summer, is enacted out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
of doors; it is the setting for the host of beautiful
flowers and shrubs which come to gladden our hearts as
the warm sun dispels the snows and mists of winter.
That style of design must be accounted best which
spares no pains to give a fair spreading lawn to every
garden, no matter what its size. Nothing tends to give
greater breadth and dignity to a place than a stretch of
well kept turf, and nothing is more restful to the eye
than the prospect of cool greensward. The lawn, or
a portion of it, should always be seen from the best parts
of the house; not even the choicest shrubs, or the richest
terrace gardens, will satisfy in the same manner. On
large lawns there may be recesses at intervals, in which
tender plants or choice colonies of lilies, backed with
rhododendrons and azalea, will receive comparative
shelter.</p>

<p>The size and shape of lawns intended for croquet and
tennis will necessarily be determined by the rules of the
game, often, unfortunately, to the detriment of the general
effect. The sunk lawn, surrounded with a low bank,
which is often made for croquet, is by no means beautiful,
and the banks, unless made with an easy slope, are
difficult to keep evenly trimmed. For both games the
designer would do well to consider the comfort of spectators,
who are frequently compelled to sit in the blazing
sun. A shady pergola with convenient openings would
be very welcome if covering a path running parallel to
the lawn; or a clipped yew hedge, though somewhat
heavy and lacking both colour and variety, might add
considerably to the pleasures of the onlookers. At any
rate, a shady cloister of living plants would be far
preferable to the stuffy little summer-house which is
often the only form of shelter.</p>

<p>The impression of space is very ably conveyed by a
good lawn, and this is the more easily attained if there
are but few walks in the vicinity. An irregular fringe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
of shrubs, with taller trees behind, the whole gradually
merging into the distant vista, is one of the most satisfactory
ways of closing in the lawn from the rest of the
garden. It is often a temptation when space is limited
to sacrifice a large portion of greensward, so that more
flowers may be grown. It would be best to consider
matters very carefully before removing a single sod of
turf. If more room is needed, a few bold masses of
herbaceous plants near the edge of the lawn will probably
give the best results. There is no defence for the
barbarous practice of dotting the grass with flower-beds,
cut in a variety of ill-considered shapes, neither should
clumps of shrubs be placed so that they destroy all sense
of perspective. The softly undulating meadow lands of
the English landscape, with their rich fringe of native
woodland, will teach the designer much of the beauty
and value of the garden lawn; and in the planning of
the best effects, he may with safety study the lessons
which Nature provides in almost every direction.</p>

<span class="chapt_sub">FORMAL AND LANDSCAPE PLANTING</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A certain</span> sense of responsibility attaches to those who
plant timber, quite out of proportion to that incurred in
the pursuit of the minor and more transitory forms of
garden arrangement and design. The builder oak, the
vine-prop elm and sailing pine, which to-day are so
small that we can carry them unaided, will develop into
mighty trees, silent witnesses of the times and doings of
generations yet unborn. We are planting for posterity,
and shall be held accountable for the good or evil that
we do. Tree planting calls forth certain motives of
unselfishness, for it will be given to others than ourselves
to see the full beauty which only maturity can
show. All honour, then, to those old designers, to
whose thought and care we owe the stately avenues,
the pride and glory of many an English home. A
beautiful tree, Nature’s gift of shade and shelter to man
and beast, is the most precious picture in a fair landscape,
and we are doing good work when with care and
foresight we increase, even in ever so humble a way, the
timber supplies of our country.</p>

<p>Avenues are perhaps the most important example of
formal planting, but as they concern park and woodland
effects rather than those pertaining to the garden, their
discussion is somewhat outside the scope of this book.
Of recent years, however, a practice has arisen among
designers of making an approach of this kind to quite
unpretentious dwellings. Even in suburban grounds we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
frequently see an avenue, perhaps no more than fifty
yards in length, leading to a modern villa. Against
this we protest, as a form of pretentious imitation,
foolish to the last degree. The avenue, which should
never be less than one hundred yards long, is essentially
associated with a house and estate of considerable size
and some measure of importance, and to attach it to a
small residence is merely to cast ridicule on the owner.
Plantations of shrubs, with a few bold groups of
deciduous trees, will give the needed shelter to carriage
drives, and at the same time allow of far greater
freedom of design than is permissible with a style of
planting which is both formal and exacting.</p>

<p>As regards the use of clipped yews for garden hedges,
much diversity of opinion exists among designers. On
the one hand, we have men who employ them in nearly
every garden they undertake to lay out, and argue that,
far from being objectionable, every opportunity should
be embraced for planting them; on the other, a class
who regard them as wholly foreign to the ideals of
beauty and the picturesque. Which is right? Certainly
not the former, for of all things tending towards
monotony both in summer and winter, an undue proportion
of evergreens—clipped evergreens especially—must
be considered the most likely. If people must
have topiary gardens, such as exist at Levens and
Elvaston, by all means let them; but, at the same time,
they should not fail to realise that these are gardens of
deformity, mere curiosities in no way connected with the
teachings of Nature. Yew hedges are the great delight
of the “office designer,” whose thought is less for the
true beauty of the living plant than for the elegant
completeness of his deftly-drawn plan. An ill-kept
hedge is a wretched sight, thin at the bottom, full of
holes, and generally decrepit, and the labour of keeping
some hundreds of yards of clipped yew in repair entails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
an amount of labour not easily realised by those who
have not attempted to do so. There can be no doubt,
too, that the near presence of hungry evergreens is
prejudicial to roses and tender plants on account of the
nourishment they demand, and the idea that they act as
harbourage to insect and other pests is also well founded.
Their merit consists in the fact that they form an
admirable shelter, certainly the best obtainable after
walls and fences, and a certain old-world air of picturesque
dignity which they impart. Despite this, their
use is constantly overdone; they are planted to distraction,
dividing the garden into chess-board squares
and alleys leading nowhere; they render the soil sour
and cold, exclude sunlight, and sooner or later wear an
appearance of gloomy desolation, especially in the
cheerless days of winter and late autumn. Had they
been used sparingly, instead of to excess, it is possible
they would still be regarded with the favour they once
enjoyed, for we must not forget the charm of the old
manorhouse gardens, where yew hedges were, and still
are, true ornaments, because highly appropriate. It is
all a question of environment, and the greatest discretion
is needed when transferring a feature of this description
to modern surroundings, depriving it in the process of
its old traditions—a relic of the past in a new and often
incongruous setting. A yew hedge sometimes looks
well when used as a boundary between the flower and
vegetable garden, a convenient arch or archways being
cut to afford communication from one to the other. A
level top is preferable to one cut into semi-circular
hollows or crenelations; and any further embellishment,
such as standard trees with oddly-shaped heads planted
at intervals, is certainly to be avoided.</p>

<p>Isolated trees, whether yew, box, mopheaded acacias
or holly, are objects of pity to the lover of natural beauty,
when he sees them transferred by the shears into cones,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
umbrellas, and other stupid shapes. There are many
reasons, some practical, others sentimental, for refraining
from this barbarous practice, which is carried on
mainly at the instigation of the architect, who is apparently
ashamed of associating his walls and terraces with
any but mutilated forms of plant life. The cost of
maintenance, as in the case of clipped hedges, is an item
not to be disparaged; the loss of form and individual
character is scant compensation for well matched regularity;
and by the absence of varied colour, the rich
tints of maturity and the delicate green of budding
branch, the clipped tree is reduced to the level of an
unresponsive object, dull and inanimate. If formality
is needed, why not make use of such trees as have a
naturally well-defined outline—the Irish yew, cupressus,
and the hardy junipers, they give a better effect with a
tithe of the trouble.</p>

<p>The bower walks, once so favoured, are now seldom
made in gardens, though as an example of formal planting
they are not without a certain charm. Adequate
protection from hot sun and cold winds is afforded at
all times, and the garden scenes are not hidden from
view, as is the case with evergreen hedges. In the
neighbourhood of the orchard, a filbert walk would be
a pleasing object, and even on poor soils, heavy crops
of nuts may be obtained after a few years.</p>

<p>The “mirthful maze” is but a stupid survival, and
has no place in gardens intended for other purposes than
beanfeasts, or for the edification of any who would not
derive equal satisfaction from a Punch and Judy show.
The pity is that places which have none too much space
for flowers and the rational arrangement of trees and
shrubs, should be cumbered with anything so utterly
unproductive of either beauty or satisfactory achievement.</p>

</figure>

<p>Natural planting as opposed to that which is guided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>by the laws of geometry, is infinitely more pleasing in
the majority of English gardens. The effective grouping
of trees, either in the form of isolated clumps or
boundary plantations, is a matter requiring great skill
and artistic perception, and it is only right that the
designer should have a hand in their disposal, even if
they occur outside the strict boundaries of the garden.
A mistaken idea, prevalent among certain owners of
property, is that garden design affects only that piece
of ground which it is proposed to lay out with beds,
lawns and walks. This is not so, for the beauty of
certain gardens lies not so much in their own attractiveness,
as on the distant views obtainable from them. Of
course there are limits to this theory, as for example the
hill gardens of Italy, with their extended vistas of rolling
mountains and fertile valleys—the hand of man is
not responsible for scenery of this type. But in English
gardens, especially those which are set in a small park,
or paddock, we expect that the same mind that designed
the garden shall also have the direction of such of the
surrounding property as is observable from it. Unsightly
objects, factory chimneys, ugly buildings, or
workmen’s cottages can usually be screened from view
by suitably disposed groups of hardy trees. The attainment
of some measure of beauty in the home landscape
will also provide an excuse for the opening out of the
garden, the reduction of boundary walls and hedges,
letting in air and sunlight, without of course rendering
the place wind swept.</p>

<p>In forming boundary plantations, there is seldom any
need for making them continuous, a form of planting
which becomes exceedingly monotonous, at the same time
defining the limits of the property in an unmistakable
fashion. Privacy and shelter are of necessity considered,
but if without defeating these objects we can secure a
vista of distant country, rich meadowlands and purple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
hills, it would be waste of opportunity not to do so.
As the outline of boundary plantations will in many
cases cut the horizon, leaving the tops of the trees showing
clear against a background of sky, great attention
should be paid to making this outline as attractive as
possible. It is a mistake to use trees of only one
kind, as this results in a level monotonous outline anything
but pleasing. The tall spire of a poplar will
give variety and point to a plantation composed almost
entirely of trees with rounded heads; a graceful birch
with its feathery outline would break the level of a
smooth belt of shrubs. Colour too is all important, a
judicious mixture of evergreen and deciduous trees is
generally preferable to a plantation composed entirely
of one class. There is no need to make the boundary
plantation straight on the inner side, whatever may be
required on the outer, and the formation of well marked
swells and bays will lend an air of charm and indefiniteness.
It is usual to plant trees of large growth on
rising ground, reserving dwarf varieties and bushes for
the hollows, but this is a rule which must be modified
according to circumstances. By a continuous system of
grouping the eye may be carried from the garden
itself to the very outskirts of the property, and this
is much more satisfactory than the plan of treating the
outer plantation as a mere fence, quite independent of
what may lie within it.</p>

<p>The indiscriminate dotting of specimen trees about
a park or garden is much overdone, and in the greater
number of cases irregular groups of trees having somewhat
similar characteristics would be far more satisfactory.
Certain trees, as the tulip tree, and the wych
elm, are well adapted for isolation on the lawn, and are
welcome for the shade they afford; but thorns, the
flowering crabs, and the Scotch firs should always be
planted in groups. As these smaller plantations are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
often required to hide some unsightly object, care
must be taken when marking out the ground that the
eyesore is hidden from every point of view. This can
generally be contrived by small subsidiary plantings,
dependent on the main group. Having staked out an
area of ground which when planted will hide the object
from the principal point, proceed to view the site from
all quarters, adding and remodelling as may be necessary.
For this, and work of a similar character, the use of
ranging poles of various heights is helpful. Supposing
that it is desired to make a small plantation with the
object of concealing an ugly building, the designer will
take up his position at the principal vantage point. An
assistant will move the poles from place to place until
the necessary width of the plantation is determined. To
decide the class of trees needed, and their height, which
should not be greater than absolutely necessary, poles
of varying heights may be raised perpendicularly, noting
the particular one which just clears the object. Supposing
this to be twenty-five feet, then trees twenty-five feet
high will be required, and knowing this it remains to
select those which are most in keeping with the surroundings,
or supply the special effects desired.</p>

<span class="chapt_sub">KITCHEN-GARDEN AND ORCHARD</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Hitherto</span> we have mainly considered that part of garden
design which has for its object the production of pleasant
scenes, of pictures formed by gay flowers, and beauteous
carpets and backgrounds of greenery. But utilitarian
ends have yet to be served, and fruits and vegetables
must be grown to supply our needs. There need be
nothing dull or prosaic about the kitchen-garden and
orchard, distinct though they be from that which is
purely ornamental. The truest garden pictures are often
to be found in these seemingly severe and business-like
quarters, and these without in any way varying the
keynote of utility, which is the chief reason for their
existence.</p>

<p>A foolish prejudice has of recent years been raised
against the kitchen-garden, and the designer is often
asked to hide it away in some remote corner of the plan.
It must be carefully screened away from the gaze of
visitors, as though there were something to be ashamed
of in being the possessor of a piece of ground, where
the best of fruits may be grown, and gathered in the
freshest condition. Personally I would rather wander
in such plebeian quarters than in many of the tricked-out
landscape gardens which excite such wonderment and
admiration. Are there not a thousand sights dear to the
heart of the nature lover—the tender blossoms of the
fruit-trees, the drowsy hum of bees, the old-fashioned
lavender hedges and reserve borders of mixed flowers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
for cutting? Even is there beauty of flower and foliage
in many of the humblest vegetables, a beauty which,
because unlooked for, is doubly welcome.</p>

<p>The site of the kitchen-garden should be fixed in
close proximity to the house and stables. On no account
should it be so arranged that a portion of the pleasure
ground must be traversed to reach it. If it can be walled
in so much the better, both on account of the added
shelter and for the facilities afforded for the growing of
wall fruit. The plan should be entirely regular, the
walks crossing one another at right angles, the fruit
borders and vegetable beds laid out with due regard to
convenience and economy of space.</p>

<p>A suitable aspect is very important—land having a
gentle slope to the south being by far the most suitable.
In any case the position should be an open one, with free
exposure to the sunlight. The presence of large trees,
whose branches overshade and roots impoverish the
soil, will be extremely prejudicial. The question of
boundaries is one in which the initial cost will be more
considered than the adaptability of various forms to
certain situations. A good yew hedge, or even a split
oak fence, may occasionally prove useful, but nothing
can equal the merits of well built walls. No doubt
they are expensive, but a close examination proves that
they are really more economical in the long run. If
well built, and properly treated, they last some hundreds
of years; they provide the best form of shelter, enabling
a variety of tender vegetables to be grown, without the
loss occasioned by cold and exposure: they afford
support for trained fruit-trees, which by their high-class
crops return no insignificant proportion of the initial
outlay. The hedge, cheaper though it is at the outset,
possesses few of these advantages. Constant attention, in
the shape of clipping and training, is necessary, if it is to
afford adequate shelter; it is many years before it is of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
sufficient size to compete with the wall; it is useless as
a support for fruit-trees, and its roots deprive the crops
in neighbouring borders of much of the fertility which
is rightly theirs. The highest walls should face the
coldest quarters, the north, east and west. A good
height for a north wall would be twelve or even fourteen
feet; for the two side walls ten feet, and for the south
wall six or seven feet. A coping, either of stone or
bricks set at an angle, should always be found on kitchen-garden
walls, the projection on either side being at least
two inches. The face of the wall should be perfectly
smooth to facilitate the training of trees, but on the
outer side buttresses or any ornamental details harmonising
with the architectural work in the rest of the garden,
may be employed to obviate monotony. Detailed
descriptions of mural work would be out of place here,
but the owner is advised to see that the wall is well
pointed, so that there shall be no crevices likely to
harbour vermin. Training wires are much better than
nailing the branches to the wall, a practice which
weakens the brickwork and involves more trouble and
risk of injury. The eyelets, at any rate the chief ones,
to which the wires will be attached and strained, should
be built into the wall and not driven in subsequently.
They will thus be much firmer in position, and the wall
will remain uninjured. Suitable irons, from which nets
may be hung as a protection from frost and birds, may
also be fixed at the same time.</p>

<p>In a stone country, this material will take the place of
bricks, as being more in keeping for garden walls.</p>

<p>A delightful approach to the kitchen-garden may be
made by way of a deeply-arched opening in the wall;
a pair of bent iron gates would look charming set in
a grey stone wall, much better than a door. Too often
the kitchen garden is gained by passing through a doorway
which suggests the entrance of a prison cell: these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
massive, nail-studded arrangements are strangely out of
keeping with the freedom and freshness of the garden.
By means of a few clumps of gay herbaceous flowers
just inside the kitchen-garden entrance, there will be no
need to screen this department off from the rest of the
garden: in fact, a very pleasant vista may be arranged
from one to the other.</p>

<p>Whether the garden is surrounded by walls or hedge,
a wide border should be formed immediately next the
boundary line. In the case of walls, this is especially
desirable, as enabling a suitable root medium to be
provided for the choice fruit-trees which will be trained
to them. These borders will vary in width, partly
according to the aspect, but mainly with reference to
the size of the garden. A twelve-foot border is perhaps
as satisfactory as any, but eighteen feet is no uncommon
width in larger establishments. Under a wall facing
north, the width of the border need seldom be more
than six feet. It is well to devote very careful attention
to the preparation of these borders, thorough drainage
being the first essential. The soil may also be removed
to a depth of two and a half feet, and a layer of stones,
brick rubbish, and other material spread at the bottom;
this will prevent the roots of the fruit-trees from striking
too deeply. If some old turf and manure be placed
above and the soil finally returned, the border will be in
the best condition for planting. A gentle fall from
back to front should be contrived, so that sun and air
may reach all parts of the crop.</p>

<p>One of the primary essentials for the kitchen-garden is
the formation of really good walks. Constant traffic, the
passage to and fro of water-carts and wheelbarrows,
would soon cut up a half-made pathway and render it
almost useless. Nothing can be nicer than broad flags,
both for appearance and utility, but unless stone happens
to be plentiful in the neighbourhood, the expense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
these would be considerable. Tar walks, though
entirely objectionable in the flower garden, are sometimes
tolerated here, and are both durable and fairly
satisfactory. A good gravel path lasts a long time if
kept constantly in repair, but the main considerations are
good gravel and plenty of it. Kitchen-garden paths
should always be of fair width, though in a small place
every available inch of ground must be pressed into
service for cropping purposes. A wide walk possesses
many advantages—it enables barrows and carts to pass
without the necessity of one or other being taken back,
and generally facilitates those operations which are in a
sense peculiar to the vegetable department.</p>

<p>Next to the pathway on the inner side, a smaller
border for herbaceous plants may be made. From these
plants the chief supplies of cut flowers for the house
would be obtained, as it is often undesirable to denude
the garden borders for the purpose. A four-foot
border would be sufficient, and when filled with gay
perennials would prove a charming and useful feature
of the design. Behind this border a suitable opportunity
occurs for a row of espalier fruit-trees, and these might
be continued round each division of the garden, with
suitable breaks at intervals for obtaining access to the
ground behind them. The smaller the garden, the
more suitable would be the espalier method of training,
as it occupies the minimum of space, allows the fruit to
ripen freely, and gives opportunity for those cultural
details which are with difficulty performed on standard
or bush trees. The usual style of fence is one formed
of iron uprights and strained wires, but this is not so
picturesque as a combination of wood and wire. If in
addition to wooden posts, a top rail is added, the effect
of the whole when covered with branches in full blossom
is beautiful in the extreme. In suitable situations,
notably short pathways leading from one part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
kitchen-garden to another, the espalier fences may be
brought almost to the edge of the walk, and the two
joined by a succession of iron arches with strained wires
from one to the other. Long bowers of fruit-trees may
thus be made, and having regard to the economy of
space thus effected, and the high quality crops which
may be obtained by this means, the practice is worthy
of further extension.</p>

<p>A good water supply, either in or near the kitchen-garden,
is very necessary. It is advisable also that some
provision exist for exposing water intended for garden
plants to the air for some time before use. A pump
with an open cistern attached is good, if not altogether
picturesque, but a circular tank, such as may be found
in many old gardens, combines both principles. A good
position for a sunk tank would be at the junction of four
paths, which if the garden is laid out on the rectangular
system advised, would be the exact centre, thereby
giving convenient access from all points. A stone
coping would give the necessary finish to the tank and
at the same time prevent anyone falling in. By the by,
it would be well if designers would sometimes devote
more attention towards rendering fountains, lily ponds,
and other such introductions, safe. I remember once
looking over some fine gardens in company with other
visitors, when an incident of this kind occurred. A
lady, carried away by the beauty of the surroundings,
entirely failed to notice a small lily tank placed at the
angle of a pathway. The consequences were disastrous,
but I hardly know which of the two suffered the more—the
lady, as she surveyed the bedraggled remains of a
Paris frock, or the owner, at the loss of a specially
choice Nymphæa. Such is the enthusiasm of the lily
specialist, that I rather incline towards the latter!</p>

<p>Adjoining the kitchen-garden and communicating
easily with it, there should be a sufficiently large enclosure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
to contain the frame ground, hot beds, compost
and manure heaps. It is a great advantage to have
these outside the walls of the garden itself, as a certain
amount of untidiness is inseparable from such quarters.
An entrance from the stable yard, large enough to admit
a horse and cart, will be needed, as naturally much of
the manure will be brought here for hot beds, preparation
of compost heaps, etc. A small reserve ground
would also fittingly adjoin, where plants for bedding
and other purposes could be grown until needed.</p>

<p>In gardens of considerable extent, a well built toolhouse
would prove an inestimable benefit. If built in
two stories, the upper portion might be used as a fruit
room, though I certainly prefer underground structures
for the purpose; whilst the lower would accommodate
lawn mowers, garden implements, and other impedimenta.
As only places of considerable extent will require buildings
of this description, it is unnecessary to do more
than make passing reference to them; however, those
whom it may concern should devote some attention to
the matter, as it is surprising to note the number of
large gardens which are miserably provided with suitable
structures.</p>

<p>The orchard is the glory of many of our old country
gardens, providing scenes of beauty which not even the
choicest artificial planning and arrangement can compass.
The orchard beautiful is perfectly distinct from the
orchard utilitarian, though owing to neglect and the
consequent assertion of Nature’s ways, the former often
takes the place of the latter. Shelter is perhaps the
most important consideration where fruit-trees are
concerned, and as in the orchard this will not be attained
by walls, thick belts of evergreen and deciduous trees
should be planted on the more exposed sides. Damsons
make excellent shelter trees, and are both beautiful in
flower and welcome in fruit. A well-drained, sunny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
position should always be chosen, and if the trees are
to be grown on the plantation system, that is on arable
land, there is no need for the site to be easily approached
from the pleasure grounds. Except during the blossom
season the utility orchard is not particularly beautiful,
and there is little inducement for visitors to make it part
of their round of inspection. However, it should
always be so situated that the fruit may be safe from
trespassers, who are often troublesome when the
orchard is close to a main road.</p>

<p>The old grass land orchard, filled with picturesque
standard trees, is capable of being made a wild garden
of true beauty. In early spring we may have troops of
golden daffodils and silvery narcissi, making vistas of
colour among the lines of grey trunks. Ropes of purple
and white clematis may festoon the trees, and some of
the semi-wild roses, with their rich foliage and single
flowers will fill the hedges and ramble over the banks.
The cool swordlike foliage of Iris, with the stately
spikes of flowers, the old-fashioned holly-hocks and
spreading clumps of poppies, may all find a home in the
chequered shade of the orchard. White Madonna lilies
will fringe the pathway, and honeysuckle and sweetbriar
would welcome us at the gate. But lest I be
misunderstood—this orchard, lovely though it be and
easy of attainment, is not for fruit; at least the crops
will be small and blemished, and very different to those
from the market grower’s plantation, where the idea of
climbers twisting among the branches of the trees
would be regarded as an act of vandalism. But to the
lover of flowers, the setting of an old orchard is so
precious, that some sacrifice is willingly made to enable
the possession of this kind of wild garden.</p>

<span class="chapt_sub">THE TREATMENT OF WATER</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Happy</span> indeed are they whose gardens contain a piece of
water,—for water when properly treated is one of the
first aids to beauty and completeness in design. It may
be a stately lake, large enough to permit of boating in
summer and skating in winter, or perhaps only a small
artificially constructed tank, a home for lilies and choice
aquatics. Water is Nature’s mirror, in which some of
her choicest pictures are reflected; the ever-changing
features of cloud and sky, the broken outline of hill and
wood, and the nearer fringe of vegetation which rises
softly from the bank. It is because water is so essentially
a handmaiden of Nature, that we must exercise the
greatest care and skill in our introduction of it, into
scenes which are purely artificial in character. Water
gardens and “water works” have nothing in common,
though designers of the latter will unhesitatingly apply
the former term to their wretched creations. What
would the beautiful old gardens of Italy be without
their fountains?—Torlania, Frascati, and the cypress
terraces of D’Este, Tivoli, their charm is not to be
equalled. But how can we reconcile to the true ideals
of a garden, the monstrous outpourings of the great
fountain and cascades at Chatsworth, the canals and
fountains at Versailles and Caserta, and those very
triumphs of ugliness the water squirts of the Crystal
Palace? As well call Trafalgar Square a garden as
apply the name to these freakish show places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>

<p>Water may occur naturally in the garden scene, as in
the form of lakes, ponds, rivers and streams, or artificially
by the introduction of fountains, cascades, and
architectural objects, connected with a supply obtained
from waterworks or pumped on the estate. In the
former case, the designer usually resorts to means more
or less artificial, whereby he may alter existing features
to suit his plan or fall in with his ideas. Whilst it
would be idle to assert that the pond or stream in its
original form would prove best adapted for securing
good effects in laid-out grounds, there can be no gainsaying
the fact, that alteration and adaptation too often
mar their natural beauty and give but little in return.
The native brook winding its way among ragged banks,
fringed with yellow flag and purple loosestrife, is
charming when its surroundings consist of wood and
brake and lush meadowland; it becomes a weedy ditch
when shaven lawns and trim pathways have taken their
place. The designer’s first thought when he approaches
a site on which there is a stream or pond, must be to
choose between two alternatives: either the water shall
be left much as it is, and the garden planned in harmony
with its unadorned simplicity, or the grounds be designed
first, and the stream entirely altered in consequence.
Needless to say, the latter step is by far the
more expensive.</p>

<p>The “landscape gardener” who has pronounced
leanings towards architecture, will treat our streamlet
with scant courtesy. Probably he will alter its course
altogether, bringing it up to his terrace garden and
confining it between strictly parallel walls of stone or
brick. The pond will fare no better, its swampy sides,
the former home of bulrushes and sedge, will be
drained, promontories will be cut away, the outline
made regular, and the whole surrounded with a balustrade,
on which stone vases will rise at intervals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
This is the view which has been embodied in the design
of hundreds of English gardens; the possession of a
scrap of water being seized upon as an opportunity for
a lavish display of dressed stone or artificial rockwork
built into an endless variety of grotesque forms. Extremes
are seldom pleasing, and the lover of flowers and
sylvan scenes will regard these monotonous canals and
round ponds as scant compensation for the loss of much
natural beauty. The artificial treatment of water,
especially when it is required to form part of a formal
scheme, is one of the most costly undertakings in the
whole practice of garden craft, and there are many who
bitterly regret the day when they took the first step
towards taming this fickle ally.</p>

<p>From this it will be inferred that I have little sympathy
with those elaborate arrangements which were
considered of such supreme beauty by Le Notre and
certain of the older designers. Not the least objectionable
feature of water which has been conveyed by pipes
or other means into basins and similar receptacles, is
that it is nearly always stagnant. Movement is essential
if sweetness and purity are to be obtained; the offensive
condition during hot weather of water in garden tanks
is the surest confirmation of this. Water is precious
because it enables the cultivation of a host of beautiful
plants, whose presence we should otherwise lack; but
healthy vegetation is almost impossible amidst the decay
occasioned by stagnation.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">STREAM AND WOODLAND</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On a small property water generally occurs in the
shape of a stream or brook, often running an irregular
course, with possibly small falls between the different
levels. A case of this kind recently came under my
notice, and I was interested to see how the owner proposed
including it in his plan. The stream entered
somewhere on the outskirts of the property, and on no
occasion passed nearer than 300 yards of the lawns and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>highly cultivated portion of the grounds. Hence there
was no question of any necessity for formal treatment;
the stream as a matter of fact might have been left
exactly as it was, without incongruity. However, it
offered opportunities of a kind not to be missed, and a
few months later I went to see what had been effected.
To begin with, the stream had been “cleaned out” for
its entire length, which meant that every particle of
water weed, every tuft of rush and sedge had been
destroyed; a quantity of mud and sludge had been
dredged up and thrown on either bank, and a bridge or
two was thrown across for no apparent purpose. By
means of a small dam, a suitable depression in the
ground had been flooded into a miniature lake, from
whose surface rose two aggressive little islands, planted
with small conifers and dotted with rocks. Clumps of
iris lined the shore, lilies had been planted, and twining
round the whole so as to give easy access to every part,
was a serpentine path, immaculately gravelled. As I
believe the owner has since repented, I mention this as
an instance of what should not be done in similar cases.</p>

<p>A more rational and certainly more artistic way of
treating this same stream, would have been to consider
it as part of the wild garden. By free drainage of the
surrounding land its volume might have been increased,
so as to give it more the appearance of an impetuous
mountain brook than a sluggish and somewhat tame little
piece of water. Each cascade might have been deepened
so as to give the water a greater fall, and small backwater
pools where lilies and water plants could be
introduced, would have added to the interest without
appearing in any way artificial. Any increased force of
water would necessitate higher banks, and these would
be built in close imitation of those already existing.
The strata being rocky, the soil might have been cleared
in places, and the bare stone exposed; it would become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
moss grown in a short time, and with a growth of ferns
in the crevices would look exceedingly well. Frequently
such streams are fringed by a plantation, through which
a pathway could be made; the walk should be brought
close to the stream at the most interesting points, and
may then meander away among the trees. The Torrent
Walk at Dolgelly is a stream of this kind, and though
in a sense a show place, parts of it are delightfully wild
and free.</p>

<p>The worst possible treatment of the stream is to make
it an excuse for the erection of trumpery rustic bridges,
unnecessary stepping stones and those varied etceteras
which are only possible near water of some description.
The designer should have in view the opportunity
which is presented him of making the stream and its
banks the home of a good collection of aquatics; if the
requirements of plant life are closely studied and carried
into effect, there will be little chance of the stream
proving anything but satisfactory.</p>

<p>Irregular shaped pieces of water are seldom satisfactory,
unless they are closely modelled on those found
in nature. Varied outline is usually considered satisfactory
in that it enables a spirit of indefiniteness to be
preserved, and the true extent of the pond or lake to
be concealed from view. Whilst this is occasionally
desirable, it is by no means invariably so, and it often
happens that all idea of breadth and dignity is lost in
the effort to secure irregularity. Numerous curves
along the shore line, and the formation of unnecessary
bays and promontories, generally stamp the work as
artificial to the last degree. To realise the principle
which partly governs the shape of such pieces of water,
it is helpful to note the action of a quick rushing stream
or river on the banks which confine it. A lake is often
but a swollen section of a stream. The only thing to
cause a deviation in the course of a river is the encountering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
of some obstacle, either a rocky promontory,
a small hill or some such obstruction. On reaching this
obstacle we invariably find that the stream is thrown
against the opposite bank with considerable force. If a
rocky strata be encountered it will be many years before
an impression is made, if the bank is soft it will be mined
away in a short time. In any case, the final results are
the same, namely the formation of a bay on the side
opposite a promontory; the more abrupt the obstruction,
the greater the force of the water, and consequently the
deeper recess of the bay. This is an elementary law
which the designer must carry into practice in order to
achieve some measures of reality in artificial lakes.
Islands are rarely necessary except in the case of large
lakes, as they lessen the extent of water, cramp the proportions,
and are in themselves of no particular beauty.</p>

<p>The saying “Plant the hills and flood the hollows”
is as true to-day as when it was first uttered. Artificial
sheets of water, constructed at great expense in elevated
positions are almost invariably incongruous. True we
have the lonely tarns perched far up on the mountain
side, but these have no semblance to the garden lake,
either in form or surroundings. Unless there is a
natural inlet and outfall for our proposed lake, the
probability is that it will ere long become foul and
stagnant, and in the absence of a feeding stream, may
run dry in the summer.</p>

<p>On the character of the planting near the margins,
will depend almost entirely the good or bad effect of
the lake. The fringe of vegetation, the overhanging
branches, and soft lawns which fall gently to the edge,
are the true beauties of which water is but the foil. Too
few trees will result in a bald, unfinished appearance,
too many will cause the water to become foul, and at the
same time destroy its power of reflection. The proper
spots for plantations are the rising banks and promontories,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
for which irregular groups of such trees as willows,
alders, rhododendrons, dogwood and birch are particularly
suited. Scrappy planting is to be avoided, boldly
defined masses of certain varieties being far more effective.
In the marshy ground near the bays, the noble
gunneras, rheum palmatum, and certain varieties of spiræa
and the larger grasses look extremely well. A list of
suitable plants for such situations will be found in
another chapter.</p>

<p>If possible, portions at any rate of the lake should
be visible from the best parts of the flower-garden, or
even from the house itself, and to attain this end vistas
should be carefully preserved by the due regulation of
timber and plantations.</p>

<p>Stone embankments quite spoil the appearance of
sheets of water, giving them a semblance to those
miniature lakes which are frequently encountered in
public gardens at the seaside. If there is a likelihood
of the banks being seriously damaged by the wash of
water, a suitable protection in exposed places may be
made by stones set in cement, the whole being afterwards
hidden with grass and trailing plants. Where
the general surroundings are wild or rocky, a lake with
gently undulating banks and sweeping outline will look
out of place; the promontories will require rougher
and more broken treatment, whilst firs, such as may be
seen on Brathay Crag, Windermere, would be more in
keeping than willows and alders, which are associated
with scenery of a milder type.</p>

<p>If the site commands a view of a fine natural sheet
of water, it is seldom advisable to create an artificial
lake. The latter is almost bound to look puny and
ridiculous, whilst comparison is invited, which seldom
tells favourably on the work of the designer. Similarly,
the artificial stream only too surely betrays its character
when a free flowing river is also included in the line of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
sight. It is seldom nowadays that we hear of water
being treated in the lavish style of design which made
Brown famous among his contemporaries. So far as the
small property is concerned, the less of Art and the
more of Nature we have, the better. In most cases,
existing effects should be jealously preserved, the designer
making it his business merely to amplify and
elaborate these without destroying their individuality.
Above all, the presence of water should be made the
excuse for an aquatic garden, than which nothing gives
greater interest and pleasure. Fountains and cascades are
very well, but they are always alike and present from
day to day the same prospect of rising or falling water.
The water garden is ever fresh, ever new, its aspect
undergoes constant alteration, owing to the growth and
change of the plants it contains. Above all the reflected
beauty of flower and branch, of cloud and summer sky,
are never failing sources of attraction, bringing home
to the most jaded mind some of the fairest and most
subtle charms of the great world of Nature.</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> the glowing colours to a beautiful picture, so are the
flowers to our gardens. In many books written on
garden design, we find no mention whatever of the best
kinds of plants, wherewith to fill the beds and borders
when they are made. Surely this is a mistake, for our
object in making a garden is to provide a home for
flowers and trees. Were an artist attempting to instruct
us in the making of a picture, he would not stop
when he had completed the rough sketch in charcoal.
The most important work has yet to come. The filling
in of the colours, the harmonising of the various shades,
and the final touches which proclaim the good or bad
workman, are points over which the novice is likely to
stumble. A faulty, ill-balanced plan will to a certain
extent ruin the appearance of our garden for all time;
but Nature is kind, and the flowers which spring
luxuriantly from the earth will by degrees help to hide
many crudities. But this fact must not be abused, as is
frequently the case with the careless worker. How
often it is said in effect “Oh, of course the garden does
not look nice yet, but wait until the things have grown,
so as to hide the ugly corners.” It is the designer’s
duty to see that there are no “ugly corners,” and there
ought to be beauty, because so full of promise, in the
bare outlines of paths, beds and lawns—the charcoal
sketch of the picture. The best effects are generally
obtained by boldly defined colour masses, providing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
course that these are arranged so as to harmonise well
with each other. The choicest flowers are of very little
use if they are jumbled heedlessly together; tall and
dwarf reds, blues, whites and yellows heterogeneously
mixed. In suggesting suitable subjects for beds and
borders, I have endeavoured to arrange the plants in
sections, according to colour, at the same time giving
a rough idea as to the height, which under ordinary
circumstances each will attain. The list makes no pretensions
whatever to completeness, the object being
rather to suggest a few really desirable subjects, many
of which are too seldom seen in our gardens.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Hardy Border Plants with White Flowers</h3>

<p><i>Lupins.</i>—Extremely valuable plants for the back of
the border, free flowering, and with handsome foliage.</p>

<p><i>Chrysanthemum Maximum.</i>—A daisy-like flower, useful
for cutting. When established it forms bold, handsome
clumps.</p>

<p><i>Asters</i>, Michælmas Daisies or Starworts.—One of the
best of these is A. Harpur Crewe; <i>multiflorus</i> with
small flowers is also desirable.</p>

<p><i>Delphiniums</i>, Larkspurs.—Well-known hardy perennials.
They are of easy culture, bloom profusely over
an extended period, and the hybrid varieties are especially
lovely.</p>

<p><i>Eremurus.</i>—These stately flowers are comparatively
little known, and the belief that they are difficult to
grow is much exaggerated. Provided that a warm
sheltered situation can be given, and that adequate protection
against severe frost is supplied, their culture is
quite simple. <i>E. himalaicus</i> is one of the hardiest of the
group, the flowers are produced in a dense raceme
often 2 feet long, and individually are of considerable
size. A delightful border plant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span></p>

<p>The height of the above may be taken roughly at six
feet.</p>

<p><i>Anemone Japonica Alba.</i>—The well-known autumn
blooming anemone, which yields quantities of flowers
for cutting. Honorine Jobert is a particularly handsome
variety.</p>

<p><i>Pæonies.</i>—These are undoubtedly the flowers of the
moment, and out of the great number of varieties
catalogued, the only difficulty lies in the selection of a
few for our needs.</p>

<p><i>Campanulas.</i>—The Peach-leaved Bellflower (<i>C. persicaefolia</i>
<i>alba grandiflora</i>) is a handsome border plant with
cup-shaped flowers. Its blooming period is July.</p>

<p><i>Achillea Ptarmica.</i>—Sneezewort. A free growing
plant, producing numerous small flowers, useful for
cutting.</p>

<p><i>Acanthus Mollis.</i>—A stately perennial, which is worth
growing if only for its handsomely serrated foliage. It
requires a warm, well-drained soil.</p>

<p><i>Phloxes.</i>—Both classes of perennial phloxes, the
summer and autumn flowering varieties, should be
included wherever space can be found for them.
Among the former, which come into bloom during June
and July, Mrs Forbes is to be recommended; in the
latter class, flowering from July to October, few are
more desirable than Avalanche.</p>

<p>The above range in height from 2 to 4 ft., and are
suitable for the middle line of the border.</p>

<p><i>Iberis.</i>—Candytuft. A suitable plant for use on the
margin of the mixed border. The variety <i>correaefolia</i>
is the best, flowering later than the ordinary kinds.
<i>Sempervirens</i> is also useful.</p>

<p><i>Saxifraga.</i>—Rockfoils. Though these plants are
generally considered more as alpines than border
subjects, they are well adapted for the latter purpose.
The beautiful fresh coloured tufts of foliage, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
myriad blossoms gracefully produced, render them
especially noteworthy. The variety <i>camposii</i> is pretty.</p>

<p><i>Pinks.</i>—These are too well-known to need comment.
In the section of the border devoted to white flowers,
a variety, like Her Majesty, can ill be spared.</p>

<p><i>Dwarf Phlox.</i>—The clustering blossoms of these
charming plants show to advantage in the front of the
border. The <i>alba</i> variety of the well-known <i>P. Subulata</i>,
and <i>P. Nelsonii</i> are both good whites.</p>

<p>These are all under a foot in height, and make a
pleasant foreground for the nobler plants behind them.</p>

<p>White flowers require to be used sparingly, as constant
repetition wearies the eye. Though generally
regarded as a positive colour, there are various shades,
and it is best to include cream tinted flowers in the
same section, using the hardest whites to give the
effect of a high light.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Plants with Yellow Flowers</h3>

<p><i>Heleniums.</i>—Few plants are better adapted for giving
quantities of cut bloom. Either <i>H. autumnale</i> or the
improved variety <i>superbum</i>, which is a noble flower,
should be grown. August to October.</p>

<p><i>Helianthus.</i>—A beautiful race of showy flowers.
The <i>rigidus</i> variety Miss Mellish, and Soleil d’Or in the
<i>decapetalus</i> section, are both worthy of a place; also
<i>giganteus</i> with flowers of a paler colour.</p>

<p><i>Bocconia Cordata.</i>—Plume Poppy. A good foliage
plant.</p>

<p><i>Rudbeckia.</i>—Coneflower. Late summer and autumn
flowering plants. <i>R. laciniata</i>, Golden Glow is one of
the best, the flowers being produced on slender stalks
in great profusion.</p>

<p><i>Verbascum.</i>—Mullein. Stately plants, attaining, when
well grown, a height of 10 ft. <i>V. Chaixi, syn. V.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
vernale</i>, is a true perennial, which is not the case with
several members of the same family.</p>

<p>All attain a height of 6 feet or over.</p>

<p><i>Oenothera.</i>—Evening Primrose. Several varieties, in
spite of their name, bloom during the day. The Sundrops
(<i>Oe. fruticosa</i>) with richly coloured flowers, and
strong, shrubby habit look charming in the mixed
border.</p>

<p><i>Coreopsis Grandiflora.</i>—The finest of all the Tickseeds,
with beautiful flowers on long stems. Especially
adapted for cutting. This should be grown in every
garden.</p>

<p><i>Doronicum Plantagineum Excelsum.</i>—Leopard’s Bane.
During the early spring and summer months, this is one
of the gayest plants in the garden. <i>D. Harpur Crewe</i> is
the best.</p>

<p><i>Lilium Testaceum.</i>—Nankeen Lily. This beautiful lily
resembles the well-known Madonna in habit, but the
delicate apricot blooms, which are fragrant, make it a
welcome addition to the section embracing yellow flowers.
A good lily for town gardens.</p>

<p><i>Anthemis Tinctoria.</i>—Camomile. Generally called the
Sulphur Marguerite. A dainty flower, unequalled for
cutting. On good soil it grows very free and bushy.</p>

<p><i>Hemerocallis.</i>—Day Lilies. These are delicately scented,
and the foliage of a well grown clump affords a welcome
break in the border. <i>H. flava</i> is the best known.</p>

<p>Any of the above would be suitable as intermediates
between the tall growing plants at the back and the
dwarf subjects in front, of which the following are
desirable.</p>

<p><i>Alyssum.</i>—<i>A. saxatile</i>, Gold Dust, as its name suggests,
produces myriads of golden blossoms. It flowers in
spring and succeeds best in an open, sunny position.</p>

<p><i>Cheiranthus Alpinus.</i>—Alpine Wallflower. A dwarf
plant, very suitable for edging.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_064_facing" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_064_facing.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">HERBACEOUS GROUPING</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>

<p><i>Linum Flavum.</i>—Yellow Flax. A hardy little plant
with gaily-coloured blossoms.</p>

<p><i>Œnothera Macrocarpa.</i>—A dwarf evening Primrose
with trailing stems on which the large flowers are
freely produced. It is perhaps better known as <i>Oe.</i>
<i>missouriensis.</i></p>

<p>The majority of the above flowers are pure yellow in
colour. Variety would of course be given by including
others varying from deep orange to pale sulphur. An
extended list is impossible in the limited space, the object
being to suggest a few flowers in the principal colours;
however, there will be no difficulty in finding others
equally suitable.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Plants with Blue Flowers</h3>

<p><i>Aconitum.</i>—Monk’s Hood. Well-known, old-fashioned
perennials, with poisonous roots. Among the best for
this section are <i>A. chinense</i> and <i>A. Napellus</i>, the former
continuing in bloom until the end of September.</p>

<p><i>Delphiniums.</i></p>

<p><i>Eryngium.</i>—Sea Holly. These strong growing plants,
with their beautiful steel-blue stems and foliage, should
be in every collection. The flower heads can be dried
and used for winter decoration. <i>E. Oliverianum.</i></p>

<p><i>Scabiosa Caucasica.</i>—On any but very cold soils this is
a true perennial. The flowers are abundantly produced
on long stalks, and are useful for cutting.</p>

<p><i>Polemonium Cæruleum.</i>—Jacob’s Ladder. An old-fashioned
plant, worthy of inclusion in modern gardens.
It blooms from early June to September.</p>

<p><i>Catanache Cærulea.</i>—Blue Cupidone. An easily grown,
free flowering plant. The colour is especially pleasing.</p>

<p><i>Centaurea.</i>—Knapweed. One of the best of this family
is <i>C. montana</i>, a variety with cottony leaves, and a profusion
of flowers not unlike the blue Cornflower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span></p>

<p><i>Iris Pallida.</i>—Great Purple Flag. The stately, swordlike
leaves rising in sheaves amid the border plants are
most welcome, and the rich velvety colouring of the
quaint flowers must appeal to all. The variety <i>Mandraliscæ</i>
should also be grown.</p>

<p>The following are dwarf growing subjects:—</p>

<p><i>Veronica.</i>—Speedwell. Among the varieties having
flowers of a true blue shade are <i>dentata</i> and <i>incana</i>, the
latter with pretty silvery foliage. <i>V. prostrata</i> is a free
bloomer of dwarf, spreading habit.</p>

<p><i>Gentiana Acaulis.</i>—Gentianella. One of the most
beautiful blue flowers we have.</p>

<p><i>Statice.</i>—Sea Lavender. The small flowers borne on
wiry stems may be cut and used for winter decoration.
<i>S. latifolia</i> is the finest of the genus.</p>

<p><i>Ajuga Osnafera.</i>—Bugle. These plants bear close spikes
of small flowers, and the effect, when boldly grouped, is
decidedly pleasing.</p>

<p><i>Anemone Angulosa.</i>—Great Hepatica. A larger flower
than the Common Hepatica; it does best in partial
shade.</p>

<p>The scarcity of really good blue flowers is known to
every gardener who has made a special study of colour
effect. Certainly the range is limited, but we are apt
to be somewhat conservative in our choice, and many
desirable plants which are now seldom seen might be
included with advantage.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Plants with Flowers in Shades of Red.</h3>

<p><i>Kniphofia.</i>—Torch Lilies. The old Torch Lily of the
cottage gardens has been superseded by some of the new
hybrids. One of the finest of the group is <i>K. Burchelli</i>,
with purple spotted stem. <i>K. nobilis</i> is another beautiful
variety. Except in quite sheltered situations <i>Kniphofias</i>
should be protected with a covering of ashes or dry litter
during winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<p><i>Lilium Chalcedonicum.</i>—One of the hardiest of the lily
tribe. The colour is exceedingly rich, and the effect of
the clustering flowers on the tall stems is remarkably
handsome.</p>

<p><i>Papaver Orientale.</i>—Oriental Poppies. Too well-known
to need comment. They should be in every
herbaceous border.</p>

<p><i>Lychnis.</i>—Another old-fashioned flower, giving glowing
spikes of colour. In a rich sandy loam it attains a
large size.</p>

<p><i>Monarda Didyma.</i>—Bergamot. An easily grown
plant, with flowers produced in whorls.</p>

<p><i>Tritonia syn. Montbretia.</i> In addition to <i>crocosmiflora</i>
which is generally grown, such kinds as <i>Etoile de Feu</i>,
and <i>Phare</i> should be included. The whole group is
very charming, resembling as they do miniature <i>gladioli.</i></p>

<p><i>Gladiolus Brenchleyensis</i>, and hybrids, of which there
are innumerable varieties, should be found in every
garden.</p>

<p>For the front of the border the following are valuable.</p>

<p><i>Mimulus Cardinalis.</i>—Monkey Flower. This showy
plant does best on a moist border, and should not be
planted if the situation is dry and parched.</p>

<p><i>Lychnis Viscaria.</i>—German Catchfly. The variety
<i>splendens</i> is the best, as being brighter in colour than
the type.</p>

<p><i>Dianthus Barbatus.</i>—Sweet Williams.</p>

<p><i>Agrostemma.</i>—Rose Campion. Well-known hardy
plants, suitable for the border. The best variety is <i>A.</i>
<i>Walkeri</i>, with compact flowers of great depth and
richness.</p>

<p>The above lists do not include plants with flowers in
shades of pink, mauve, rose, purple, violet and other
elusive hues. These, however, must be used in conjunction
with the more pronounced colours to produce
the best effects. In order to avoid discord, red flowers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
should not be grouped near those in shades of blue,
purple or lilac. The warm colours are easily arranged,
and beginning with pink, may pass to rose, crimson and
finally scarlet. Following these comes a procession of
yellows, from orange to pale sulphur, when an opportunity
occurs for introducing flowers in shades of mauve,
lilac and violet. Blues are best approached by pale
yellows and creamy whites. However no absolute rules
can be given, the matter being one for the exercise of
good taste and an eye for colour.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> every garden, no matter how small, should
contain its herbaceous border, well stocked with hardy
perennials, only a comparatively small number will admit
of those delightful features, the bog, aquatic and alpine
gardens. For this reason I shall not attempt to give
more than a brief list of the plants suited to each. In a
book which attempts to outline all, or at any rate the
chief points connected with garden design, consideration
of individual sections must necessarily be brief. I have
endeavoured to mention all the most deserving plants in
the following lists, but for further and fuller information
the reader is advised to consult a work specially dealing
with the particular “garden” in which he is interested.</p>

<p>In many places there are pieces of rough marshy land,
unsightly through neglect, filled with sedges and rough
tussocky grass, which might, with the expenditure of a
little trouble, be converted into charming bog and water
gardens. There are such hosts of delightful little plants,
which thrive only in thoroughly moist situations, and are,
therefore, but seldom seen in English gardens, that an
opportunity for growing them must not be lost. Bog
plants are many of them diminutive, but there are few
which are not interesting, and to know them a little is to
desire their further acquaintance. The same may be said
of aquatics, though these belong to a very different class.
Anyone who has seen the gorgeous water-lilies, which
have been steadily finding their way into English ponds
and tanks during the last few years, must realise that a
water garden is worth making for their sake alone.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_070_facing.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A LILY TANK</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The following plants are suitable either for growing
in the water itself or for grouping on the margins of
ponds and streams:—</p>

<p><i>Nymphæa.</i>—Water-Lilies. The beautiful hybrids,
which are associated with the name of M. Marliac are
by far the most handsome of available kinds. Among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>them the Canary Water-lily (<i>N. M. chromatella</i>), with
reddish brown leaves and soft yellow flowers, darkening
to the centre, is very beautiful. <i>N. Robinsoni</i> is another
fine variety with rose-coloured blooms, abundantly produced.
Our own native lily (<i>N. alba</i>) flowers early, and
should be in every collection, but the variety <i>rosea</i> is a
shy bloomer, though the colour is extremely pretty.
<i>N. tuberosa.</i></p>

<p><i>Aponogeton.</i>—The Cape Pond-flower. A pretty water
plant, the flowers are white and delicately scented. It
requires fairly deep water, and does best in a warm
district. <i>A. distachyon.</i></p>

<p><i>Villarsia.</i> Yellow Buckbean. Small lily-like leaves,
and a profusion of yellow flowers.</p>

<p><i>Stratiotes.</i>—Water Soldier. Interesting on account of
its foliage.</p>

<p>Shallow water is needed for the following:—</p>

<p><i>Typha Latifolia.</i>—The Common Bulrush.</p>

<p><i>Sagittaria.</i>—Arrowhead. Handsome plants with white
blossoms and arrow-shaped leaves.</p>

<p><i>Caltha Palustris.</i>—Marsh Marigold.</p>

<p><i>Pontederia.</i>—Pickerel Weed. Graceful foliage, with
spikes of blue flowers.</p>

<p><i>Butomus Umbellatus.</i>—Flowering Rush. Bears umbels
of rosy flowers.</p>

<p><i>Menyanthes Trifoliata.</i>—Buckbean. Grows freely, the
scented white flowers being faintly suffused with pink.</p>

<p>A few good plants for localising in marshy ground on
the margin:—</p>

<p><i>Iris Kaempferi.</i> The Japanese Flag. A more strikingly
beautiful subject for the position could scarcely be
found. The swordlike foliage, and large handsome
flowers render it especially noteworthy.</p>

<p><i>Gunnera.</i>—Prickly Rhubarb. Noble plants, with immense
fan-shaped leaves. They should be slightly
protected during winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p><i>Osmunda Regalis.</i>—Royal Fern.</p>

<p><i>Spiræa Palmata.</i> Fine foliage. The flowers produced
in dense clusters are a soft rosy pink.</p>

<p><i>Arundo Donax.</i>—The Great Reed.</p>

<p><i>Buphthalmum Speciosum.</i> A handsome plant with
heart-shaped leaves. The flowers are yellow with dark
centres.</p>

<p><i>Gynerium Argenteum.</i>—Pampas Grass.</p>

<p><i>Lythrum Salicaria.</i>—Purple Loosestrife. This is the
well-known showy plant of the country streams. For
garden culture the improved variety <i>roseum</i> should be
grown.</p>

<p>The plants enumerated above will make an interesting
collection for the water garden, others can be added from
time to time. The great point to be observed is the
proper regulation of plants of varying growth, so as to
prevent overcrowding. Water gardens are frequently
made and filled with interesting subjects, but owing to
neglect the coarse growing plants are allowed to monopolise
the space and crowd out those of shyer habit.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Plants for the Bog Garden</h3>

<p><i>Cypripedium Spectabile.</i>—Mocassin-flower. This is perhaps
the finest of all bog plants, and hails from the
woods of North America, where it grows to perfection.
The plant forms handsome clumps, and the flowers are
white marked with a rosy blotch.</p>

<p><i>Primula Japonica.</i>—This plant revels in the cool surroundings
of the bog garden, and produces an abundance
of rich crimson blossoms. <i>P. rosea</i> is a smaller variety,
with polyanthus tufts of delicate pink flowers. <i>P. sikkimensis</i>,
with pale yellow flowers, is distinct.</p>

<p><i>Dielytra Spectabilis.</i>—Bleeding Heart.</p>

<p><i>Trillium.</i>—Wood Lily. A beautiful plant, with rich
green foliage and snowy three-petalled flowers.</p>

<p><i>Parnassia Palustris.</i>—Grass of Parnassus. An easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
grown plant, with white flowers on long straight
stems.</p>

<p><i>Anagallis Tenella.</i>—Bog Pimpernel. Creeping habit.
The flowers are pink.</p>

<p><i>Pinguicula.</i>—Butterwort. The wettest spots in the
bog should be chosen for this little plant.</p>

<p><i>Adiantum Pedatum.</i>—Maidenhair fern. This is the
hardy North American kind, which looks well associated
with the flowering plants in sheltered corners.</p>

<p><i>Orchis Foliosa.</i>—Madeira Orchis. One of the finest of
the family. It produces bold spikes of purplish flowers.</p>

<p><i>Ficaria Grandiflora.</i>—An improved form of the common
Pilewort. Its bright masses of golden flowers render it
a welcome addition to the bog garden in spring.</p>

<p><i>Saxifraga Peltata.</i></p>

<p>The above are all more or less dwarf growing plants,
and suited for bog gardens on a small scale. In larger
places good use will be made of Rhododendrons, Ferns
of various kinds, Sedges, and numerous Lilies, especially
<i>superbum</i>, to give boldness and distinction to the scene.
It is a mistake, when it can be managed otherwise, to
grow only small plants, as the effect is generally patchy
and insignificant, besides giving the bog a dull, flat
appearance. So many beautiful flowering shrubs and
hardy lilies grow best in a peaty soil, so that on the
fringe of the bog, where the ground is drier, whole
colonies of beautiful plants may come trooping down to
the edge, shutting off the little enclosure from the rest
of the garden. Good drainage and the destruction of
weeds are points essential to success, and a close watch
should be kept for stray plants of Sheep Rot, which if
allowed to spread will choke the whole bog in a short
time.</p>

<span class="chapt_sub">FLOWERING TREES AND SHRUBS</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> majority of English gardeners are slow to recognise
the value of the various flowering shrubs as an aid to
the carrying out of design. Our gardens, as a whole,
are far too sombre, a result of planting extensively with
dark, close growing evergreens, which keep out the
light, and reduce our pleasure grounds to the verge of
monotony. Evergreens are well enough in their way,
and in certain instances form valuable screens to unsightly
corners at all times of the year. But their use has been
overdone, and by their presence they are crowding out
a host of beautiful subjects, graceful and varied in their
mode of growth, and productive, also, of that most
needed element in our often saddening atmosphere—colour.
Small gardens, especially, can ill afford to be
overplanted with laurel and privet, a form of encroachment
to which they are particularly liable. The majority
of evergreens are greedy feeders, and their hungry roots
travel in all directions, impoverishing the soil in the beds
and borders, which, owing to lack of space, have to be
formed in their near vicinity. The prejudice which exists
against deciduous trees is in reality quite unfounded, as
anyone must realise who has taken the trouble to examine
the structural beauty of trees which shed their leaves.
The exquisite tints of autumn, the gradual revealing of
hidden beauties in bark and stem as the summer mantle
is discarded, are sights we look for in vain in evergreens.
Summer and winter they hardly vary, and gardens in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
which stiffly growing hollies, dusty yews, and straggling
laurels monopolise nearly all the space, are usually lacking
in interest just when they should be full of charm. If
some of the old shrubberies filled with worn out, decaying
evergreens could be rooted up, letting in the air
and sunshine, how much better would it be. Their
place might be taken by a varied collection of graceful,
deciduous trees and shrubs, which during their flowering
period would afford constant interest and pleasure. Of
course a garden from which evergreens were entirely
banished, would be bare and cheerless to a degree during
the winter months. Besides, the more tender plants
would undoubtedly suffer, owing to the sudden inlet of
cold winds, from which they had previously been protected.
As shelter trees and wind breaks, evergreens
are of the utmost utility, and their value in this direction
cannot be over-estimated. Judiciously planted and used
in moderation they are always pleasing, it is only by
constant repetition, and the formation of dense, gloomy
thickets, that the designer wearies us by their presence.</p>

<p>Granted, however, that evergreens have a certain
value, there is no reason why we should not aim at
greater variety than is at present the case. In addition
to the ever present laurels, there are whole families of
Rhododendrons, Barberries, Olearia, Kalmia, certain of
the Heaths, Daphne in sheltered situations, Cotoneaster,
and many others. These are all beautiful at their flowering
period, and at other times, by their diversity of form
and habit, will make a welcome change to the existing
conditions. I have felt it desirable to draw attention to
the need for further recognition of the flowering shrubs,
both deciduous and evergreen; they present so much
variety and charm, and are, moreover, adapted to such a
variety of situations, that it seems unreasonable to exclude
them from our gardens. Another point in their favour
is the supply of decorative bloom which is obtainable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
from such free flowering subjects as the various Quinces,
Brooms, Weigela, Syringa, and others. Whole branches
of bud and blossom look exquisite when lightly arranged
in jars and vases, the Japanese methods being worthy of
imitation, so that in both garden and house endless possibilities
are presented to the modern gardener. In order
to recall a few of the best varieties, nearly all of which
are hardy, I give a list of those which have proved
deserving of a place.</p>

<p><i>Azalea.</i>—These beautiful flowers should be grown
much more extensively. Not only during their flowering
period, but in the full glory of their autumn foliage,
they are supremely lovely. An endless number of
varieties are available, the hardy Ghent Azaleas with a
fine range of colour being perhaps best for general purposes.
<i>A. mollis</i>, a dwarf Japanese variety, is useful for
grouping in front of the larger kinds. Those living in
the south, or having gardens with sunny, sheltered dells,
may also plant <i>A. Indica</i>, which is a sub-evergreen.
Let no one be deterred from growing these beautiful
shrubs under the impression that they require peat; in
ordinary garden soil they thrive wonderfully, if protected
from cold winds.</p>

<p><i>Magnolia.</i>—Beautiful flowering shrubs from China and
Japan. <i>M. conspicua</i> bears a profusion of snowy blossoms
early in May. A dwarf growing variety with starry
white flowers, <i>M. stellata</i>, should be grown in sheltered
corners. At Kew the effect of bold groups of Azaleas
and Magnolias in the open may be seen during the spring
and early summer months.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_076_facing" >
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_076_facing.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">A GARDEN HOUSE</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><i>Rhododendrons</i> form gardens in themselves, such is the
variety of habit and colouring which they display. Nevertheless
they are often overplanted, and when out of flower
the banks of evergreen foliage become monotonous. A
better plan is to choose a few really good hybrid varieties
and group them carefully according to colour and period
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>of flowering, interspersing with shrubs of different growth
to prevent monotony. Almost every shade from white
to deep crimson is to be found in these showy flowers.
Limestone soils are very prejudicial to their welfare, but
otherwise they succeed in a diversity of situations.
Numbers of hybrid kinds are catalogued, and it is an
easy matter to choose a dozen or so really desirable
varieties.</p>

<p><i>Cytisus.</i>—Broom. The Common Broom (<i>C. Scoparius</i>)
is by no means to be excluded from our gardens, where
its cheerful presence in the semi-wild parts is very
welcome. Among cultivated varieties the beautiful
white form <i>C. albus</i> is very graceful, with its long dark
green sprays covered with snowy flowers. <i>C. Andreanus</i>
is similar in form to the common variety, but the yellow
flowers are richly marked with blotches of reddish
chestnut.</p>

<p><i>Prunus.</i>—This is a large family containing the flowering
Plums, Almonds, Peaches, and Cherries. Almost
all are beautiful, with their soft masses of rosy pink and
white flowers borne on branching twigs and sprays.
The Japanese Cherry (<i>P. pseudo-Cerasus</i>), which the Japs
will tramp for miles to see in all its beauty, has many
good double varieties, one of the best being <i>Cerasus
Watereri</i>. <i>P. Padus</i>, the Bird Cherry, should, in its
double form, certainly be included among the garden
trees. Then there is the Double Chinese Plum
(<i>P. japonica</i>), with delicate pink and white flowers
borne on slender shoots. <i>P. Lauro-Ceraus</i>, the Cherry
Laurel, a fine evergreen, which requires plenty of space,
and should not be crowded in among more delicate
growers. The common Almond (<i>P. amygdalus</i>) is well-known,
especially in town gardens, its beautiful pink
flowers being produced early in the season. In spite of
its general use in our gardens we could ill spare the
Portugal Laurel (<i>P. lusitanica</i>), it is a noble evergreen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
and worthy in many cases of better treatment. A
beautiful little dwarf shrub is <i>P. triloba fl. pl.</i>, with
large blush flowers, changing with age to pure white.
It is worth almost any consideration to secure a small
representative collection of this family for our gardens.
<i>P. pissardi.</i></p>

<p><i>Pyrus (Cydonia) Japonica.</i>—A well-known shrub, producing
a profusion of vivid scarlet blossoms over an
extended period. The fruit, which appears in autumn,
is of considerable size. A variety <i>alba</i>, with white
flowers, should also be grown.</p>

<p><i>Philadelphus.</i>—Mock Orange. Well-known old-fashioned
shrubs, the syringa of the cottage gardens.
They deserve an open, sunny position, when they will
form really handsome bushes, covered with a wealth
of sweetly scented blossoms. <i>P. coronarius</i> is the common
variety, and in the same section we have <i>aureus</i> with
golden leaves; <i>primulæflorus</i> with double white flowers;
and <i>nanus</i>, a dwarf form, which, however, is a shy
bloomer. <i>P. grandiflorus</i> has much finer flowers than
<i>coronarius</i>, and is but slightly scented, an advantage
when the branches are used for indoor decoration, the
common form being almost too powerful in a room.
<i>P. microphyllus</i> is an excellent dwarf variety, forming a
compact bush about 3 feet high.</p>

<p><i>Viburnum.</i>—Guelder Rose. The beautiful snowball-like
flowers of this shrub are extremely ornamental, and
it deserves a worthy place in the garden. <i>Sterile</i>, the
cultivated form of the native <i>V. opulus</i>, grows to a good
height, and may be planted well back in the mixed
shrubbery. <i>V. plicatum</i> is somewhat different in habit,
producing continuous sprays of large, white blossoms.</p>

<p><i>Stuartia.</i>—A deciduous shrub bearing flowers something
like the <i>Camellia</i>. <i>S. pseudo-Camellia</i> has creamy-white
blossoms with yellow stamens. <i>S. virginica</i>
forms a handsome bush, the flowers the same colour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
as the foregoing, with the addition of blood red
stamens.</p>

<p><i>Ribes.</i>—Flowering Currant. Too well-known to need
description. In addition to the common variety <i>R. sanguinea</i>,
the Buffalo Currant (<i>R. aureum</i>), with yellow
flowers, and the double form <i>flore-pleno</i>, which blooms
later than the type, should also be grown.</p>

<p><i>Syringa.</i>—Lilac. Grouped in bold masses, the Lilac
family is a charming one in the garden. A sheltered
corner devoted to a representative collection, or a good
hedge formed of several varieties, is the way in which
they should be grown. A straggling bush, hemmed in
by coarse evergreens, is a poor way of displaying so
charming a flower. The following are worthy of notice:
<i>S. chinensis</i>, with rich violet flowers; <i>S. japonica</i>, with
large creamy-coloured flowers; and <i>S. persica</i>, the
Persian Lilac, a much smaller kind, which looks well
planted in the foreground of large groups. The flowers
are pale mauve. The white variety, <i>Marie Lagrange</i>, is
very handsome.</p>

<p><i>Choisya Ternata.</i>—Mexican Orange-flower. Not quite
hardy, but worth a sheltered position, on account of its
shining evergreen foliage and abundance of pure white
flowers. It is a good plant for warm seaside districts.</p>

<p><i>Cotoneaster.</i>—Rockspray. Hardy and easily grown
rock-shrubs. <i>C. buxifolia</i> forms a good-sized bush, the
flowers white, and produced abundantly. <i>C. microphylla</i>
is useful for walls or sloping banks in the rock garden,
where there is a bare space which needs covering. The
Cotoneasters are evergreen, and in winter are rendered
bright and showy by clusters of scarlet or crimson
berries.</p>

<p><i>Forsythia.</i>—Golden Bell. Dwarf growing subjects, of
exceedingly graceful habit. <i>F. suspensa</i> is the best
known, and the long trailing branches, covered with
golden blossoms, look especially well hanging over a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
bank or low wall. <i>F. viridissima</i> is more compact than
the foregoing, and likes a position fully exposed to the
sun.</p>

<p><i>Deutzia.</i>—The hardy outdoor kinds are <i>crenata</i> and
<i>flore-pleno</i>, both with white flowers, those of the latter
being faintly tinged with pink. The slender stems and
clustering racemes of flowers render this a delightful
shrub.</p>

<p><i>Kalmia.</i>—Mountain Laurel. Charming evergreen
shrubs from North America. The waxy flowers are
produced in clusters, the colour being a delicate rose.
<i>K. latifolia</i> is the best, and will thrive in garden soil in
which there is a slight admixture of peat. On limestone
soils they are seldom a success.</p>

<p><i>Berberis.</i>—Barberry. The best of the group is <i>B.
Darwinii</i>, an evergreen variety with showy orange
flowers. <i>B. vulgaris</i>, the Common Barberry, is more
beautiful in fruit than in flower, a charming companion
being <i>B. Thunbergii</i>, with bright scarlet berries, and
foliage turning to a rich tint in autumn. The <i>Mahonias</i>
are also included under this head, of which the common
variety, <i>M. aquifolium</i>, should be in every collection.
Its copper-coloured leaves, bright yellow flowers and
purple berries, afford a good contrast to other plants in
the shrubbery.</p>

<p><i>Weigela.</i>—Bush Honeysuckle. Charming groups of
these shrubs may be formed on the edges of lawns and
other suitable places. There are many varieties, nearly
all beautiful, their autumn foliage being particularly
well coloured. <i>W. rosea</i> is the form generally met with,
but it is hardly so deserving as <i>W. grandiflora</i>, or
<i>anabilis</i>, as it is often known. There is a fine golden-leaved
kind, <i>W. Looymansi aurea</i>, which may be grown
if space can be found.</p>

<p><i>Rhus.</i>—Sumach. More quaint, perhaps, than beautiful,
but worth planting, if only for their truly gorgeous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
foliage during the fall of the leaf. The Venetian
Sumach (<i>R. cotinus</i>) is one of the best.</p>

<p><i>Tamarix.</i>—Tamarisk. Excellent shrubs for seaside
gardens. The flowers of <i>T. gallica</i> are white, tinged
with pink, and the small spikes look exceedingly well
among the feathery leaves.</p>

<p><i>Spiræa</i>.—Shrubby Meadow Sweet. A large family
numbering many delightful varieties. It is useless
crowding these Spiræas among a tangle of rampant
evergreens, as their graceful beauty is lost and they are
soon destroyed. Well-defined clumps on lawn margins
show them at their best. <i>S. ariæfolia</i>, the Spray Bush,
is very lovely with its panicles of white flowers. <i>S.
japonica</i>, with clusters of pink flowers borne on slender
stems, is another good kind; and the improved variety,
Anthony Waterer, with blossoms of a rich crimson hue,
is most striking. The Plume Meadow Sweet (<i>S.
Lindleyana</i>) is a large and handsome kind, which requires
a fairly warm position, when its beautiful foliage is
particularly attractive.</p>

<p><i>Hydrangea Paniculata Grandiflora.</i>—Plumed Hydrangea.
During the autumn this is one of the handsomest plants
in the shrubbery. Under good culture it produces
enormous clusters of white flowers, the whole bush
being often covered with a profusion of bloom.</p>

<p><i>Kerria Japonica.</i>—There are few cottage gardens
without a bush of old-fashioned Jew’s Mallow. The
long shoots are wreathed with small golden blossoms.
There is a variegated form of the single variety, which
is dwarfer than the commonly grown <i>flore-plena</i>.</p>

<p>There is hardly a plant in the above list which is not
really beautiful, and fully deserving a place in the garden.
But space cannot be found for even half of them, still
less for many more which I have not mentioned, if the
old-fashioned shrubbery is to still monopolise all the
available ground. By all means let us have a few evergreens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
to clothe our gardens during their winter nakedness,
but in spring and summer the beautiful flowering
trees and shrubs should be there to brighten with their
blossomed sprays the corners where now sombre, dusty
foliage forms the only relief. If many desirable names
have been omitted, it is because space cannot possibly be
found for all, or perhaps that they lack the hardiness
which is one of the first points which must be considered
when introducing new varieties. In warm, sheltered
spots, such as occur in Devon and Cornwall, there is no
end to the really beautiful trees and shrubs which may
be grown. Here fuchsias and members of the magnolia
family will thrive and bloom freely, but in less favoured
localities we must content ourselves with more hardy
subjects, of which there are numbers from which to make
a choice.</p>

<span class="chapt_sub">HARDY CLIMBERS</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> would be impossible to over-estimate the value of the
various climbing plants to the designer; without them
our gardens would lose half their beauty and charm.
This much we owe to them, that without their graceful
presence many beautiful garden houses, outbuildings and
walls, would be intolerable eyesores. But for our
climbing roses, clematis, honeysuckle, and fragrant
jasmine, there would be no possibility of shady pergolas,
flower-clad archways, and welcome arbour. The crudities
of the architect, his ugly terrace walls and staring
porticos, may all be softened and veiled by a tender
covering of flowery sprays and rich green foliage. Yet,
in spite of this, more effective use might be made of
plants of twining and scandent habit, not only by calling
in the aid of several beautiful subjects which are now
seldom seen, but by displaying those we have to further
advantage. In the wild gardens of Nature we find that
climbers choose for their support living trees and shrubs,
and who will gainsay the charm of the hedgerow wreathed
in honeysuckle, or of the beauty of the wild rose which
has scrambled by chance amid the branches of some
forest tree. How seldom we afford the cultivated
climbers this form of support. On the stronger growing
trees we may have the snowy <i>clematis montana</i>, flinging
its blossom-clad trails from branch to branch; vines and
gorgeous Virginian creeper garlanding the trunks, and
hanging pendant from the nethermost boughs. The axe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
may even be stayed from a dead or dying elm; instead,
allowing the mauve and white wistarias to twine their
way upwards, and cover the withered stump with new
life and loveliness. By selecting climbers of less rampant
growth, the evergreen shrubs may be wreathed with
many a fragrant spray, all the more beautiful because of
the freedom from artificial planning and arrangement. In
this way endless possibilities are opened before us, of
which we should not fail to take advantage. The following
list of hardy climbers will, it is hoped, afford
some assistance to those in need of suitable plants for a
variety of purposes:—</p>

<p><i>Roses.</i>—The Queen of Flowers is worthy of a volume
to herself, and it would be impossible to give anything
like an adequate description of a tithe of the climbing
varieties, within the limits of this chapter. The following
list embraces some of the most beautiful climbing
forms in cultivation.</p>

<p><i>Aimée Vibert.</i>—Small white flowers borne in large
clusters. Beautiful for the pergola.</p>

<p><i>Celine Forestier.</i>—Sulphur-yellow, free blooming.</p>

<p><i>Devoniensis.</i>—White, with creamy shading, large and
full.</p>

<p><i>Felicité Perpétue.</i>—<i>R. Sempervirens.</i> The foliage is
evergreen, and the clustering white flowers are faintly
tinged with pink.</p>

<p><i>Crimson Rambler.</i>—Invaluable. A quick grower, soon
clothing pillar or pergola with its bright green foliage,
among which the trusses of vivid blossoms show to
advantage. <i>Euphrosyne</i> with rosy flowers; <i>Thalia</i>,
white; and <i>Aglaia</i>, yellow are also useful, but the
crimson form is the best.</p>

<p><i>W. A. Richardson.</i>—Yellow and orange flowers, with
beautiful copper coloured buds. Fine for arches and
low walls.</p>

<p><i>Paul’s Carmine Pillar.</i>—A single variety with bright<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
carmine flowers. It is quite hardy and looks well
covering a trellis. One of the best single climbers.
The Single White is also desirable.</p>

<p><i>Alice Grey.</i>—Belonging to the Ayrshire section.
Blooms in summer, the flowers are creamy white, edged
with pink.</p>

<p><i>Banksia.</i>—Delicately scented and well adapted for
walls. Both the yellow and white should be grown,
also the improved variety <i>Fortunei</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gloire de Dijon.</i>—Well-known, should be in every
garden.</p>

<p><i>Rosa Brunonis.</i>—White Indian Rose. Fine foliage.
The single creamy flowers are beautifully centred with
yellow. A lovely variety for rambling among trees.</p>

<p><i>Rosa Moschata Nivea.</i>—Musk Rose. Another single.
The flowers are scented, the colour white, suffused with
pink, and the centre of each occupied by a bunch of
golden anthers, the buds pink. Very free growing.</p>

<p><i>Austrian Briars.</i>—For rambling over dwarf trellis or
about the base of stone balconies these roses are most
useful. Both the yellow and copper-red forms are
worth growing.</p>

<p><i>Rosa Rubrifolia.</i>—Red-leaved Rose. Of little importance,
so far as its flowers are concerned, but delightful
for its richly coloured leaves and purple shoots.</p>

<p><i>Rêve d’Or.</i>—Belonging to the <i>Noisette</i> section. A
favourite variety with nankeen copper flowers, and a
profusion of rich brown shoots.</p>

<p><i>Lamarque.</i>—White with yellow centre, a free flowering
kind, growing well on a wall.</p>

<p><i>Sweet Briar.</i>—(Lord Penzance Hybrids.) These are
a lovely new race, combining the sweetness of the old
Sweet Briar, with a wonderful colour range in the
flowers. They are generally used for hedges, but look
well trained as pillar roses. A few ought to be in every
garden on account of their fragrance. The following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
are good kinds:—Meg Merrilies, rich crimson; Lady
Penzance, soft copper; Brenda, blush; Julie Mannering,
delicate pink; Minna, white; Anne of Geierstein, deep
crimson; Jeannie Deans, semi-double, vivid crimson;
Rose Bradwardine, clear rose.</p>

<p><i>Clematis.</i>—There are but few positions in which these
will not appear charming. Porches, arbours, trellis and
pergola all look lovely when wreathed with some of the
new hybrids; whilst the Traveller’s Joy (<i>C. Vitalba</i>)
forms beautiful garlands among the branches of the
larger trees. <i>C. montana</i>, with its myriad white blossoms,
is one of the best for the house. <i>C. Jackmanii</i>, with
purple flowers, looks well among the grey oaken beams
of the pergola, but neither this nor other of the mauve
and violet kinds show to advantage near red walls.
Among the hybrids are Beauty of Worcester, Duchess
of Edinburgh, Mme. Edouard Andre, Jackmanii alba,
Miss Bateman, Stella, and Belle of Woking, all beautiful.
The Scarlet Clematis (<i>C. coccinea</i>) is very pretty and
distinct, but a warm sheltered position is essential to its
well-being. The flowers are bell-shaped, the sepals
fleshy, and the colour a rich carmine scarlet.</p>

<p><i>Lonicera.</i>—Honeysuckle. Fragrant climbers for trellis
or pergola. They also look well twining among the
branches of trees with dark foliage. A sunny, open
position suits them best. <i>L. Japonica</i>, with leaves somewhat
like the oak, is a pretty form, quite hardy; the
variety <i>aureo-reticulata</i>, with leaves overlaid with a network
of gold, is also beautiful. A warm wall is needed
for <i>L. sempervirens</i>, with handsome tubular flowers in
shades of scarlet and yellow. The winter flowering
kind, <i>fragrantissima</i>, with white flowers, is sweetly
scented. An early bloomer.</p>

<p><i>Jasminum.</i>—<i>J. officinale</i>, the White Jasmine, is a quick
grower, soon covering an arbour, for which position it
is perhaps best suited. <i>Nudiflorum</i> should be grown on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
account of its welcome note of colour, when the garden
is otherwise dull and bare.</p>

<p><i>Wistaria Sinensis.</i>—A beautiful woody climber, delightful
for the pergola, in which position its long
racemes of mauve flowers are seen to great advantage.
The variety <i>alba</i> is also fine. <i>Wistarias</i> might be more
often grown among trees, especially if the latter are
past their prime, and so will not suffer from the embrace
of so large and free growing a climber.</p>

<p><i>Tecoma.</i>—Trumpet Creeper. Fine scarlet corymbs,
but must have the shelter of a south wall in all but
southern counties.</p>

<p><i>Tropæolum Speciosum.</i>—Flame Flower. A gorgeous
creeper which often defies all efforts at establishment.
The Lakeland cottages are often enveloped in its glowing
trails, which also look beautiful wandering over sombre
yews or dark leaved shrubs. Partial shade.</p>

<p><i>Cratægus Pyracantha.</i>—Evergreen foliage and brilliant
scarlet berries. Suitable for a wall.</p>

<p>To this list must be added the Ivies in great variety,
<i>Ampelopsis tricuspidata</i> (syn. <i>Veitchi</i>), <i>A. quinquefolia</i>,
Virginian Creeper and the Vines.</p>

<p>More fragile than the foregoing, yet of distinct value,
are the Hops, the gaily-flowered <i>Cobæa scandens</i>, <i>Eccremocarpus</i>,
the double pink <i>Calystegia</i>, and the Everlasting
Peas. These look well among the smaller shrubs,
which would soon be choked out of existence by the
more rampant varieties which have been noticed. In
really warm districts the beautiful <i>Passiflora</i> will also be
pressed into service, but it belongs to the fortunate few
to grow these and other tender climbers in the open.</p>
